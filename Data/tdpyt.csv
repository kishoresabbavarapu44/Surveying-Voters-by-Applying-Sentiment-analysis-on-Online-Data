"FSL: Same voice (when he said on 31st May 2015 caught when he said...  They Briefed me)  
Yellow Media: They tapped phones, they did cut and copied... 
CBN: What I'm saying...  What I'm saying I'm the senior politician in the country.. 
Me: Google and you'll find all the answers.."
Arnab ur question doesn't make sense.. if a local party has been betrayed by ruling national party their only option to support further will be the opposition party weather it is Congress or kejriwal or arnab in the opposition.. He is talking about people problem and ur questions r like a police investigation..
Only 2.5 crore voters supported TDP. How can he claims entire AP PEOPLE SUPPORTED TDP. ???
You are a SSSS POLITICIAN
We AP people are not sentimental people. We will choose right person as state head in the coming elections. CBN trying to show the BJP as a CULPRIT.  Sorry for it.
Andhra CEO (CBN)
jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiCBN Andhra CEO jaiiiiitdp
Worst Politician... In INDIA
Andhra deserves to know. Why is Chandrababu joining with enemies of NTR?
Naidu hatao Ap bachao
Chandrababu  is a seasonal politician
Chandra babu worst cm of the India.
"Respected “What I am saying” garu ,
                                                                   You guys said special package is far better than the special status and now why you guys are asking about special status instead of special package. You guys need to ask for special package right? Because in your thoughts special package is better for AP right? And you guys warned AP people if anybody raised their voice about the special status, we will put them in Jail."
Arunab ji. Please ask very tough questions to CBN. He hasnt given any answer to ur question. CBN was the person who said not required special status for AP. He accepted special package from Indian government (BJP) . He took U turn now as TDP has no alliance with BJP . He is very selfish about his power. He kept on changing his words all the time. Please analysis about him before asking questions. I  think national media ignore AP. CBN is managing all media channels in AP. We have completely lost faith on Telugu media channels. I am having great respect and faith on you. Please focus sometime on AP to show the reality of CBN.
"Finally, does Naidu trust Rahul Gandhi or not?"
Mr.Chandra babu is one of the best CM in India.... greetings from tamizhan
Mr. Naidu is correct AP should get the promised favours.
"he is not sr.most in country. in hyd who led a foundation for IT in AP. fruad CBN claims that.   
which is succed that was by Che BN he says but reality was not . 
CBN IS prostitue in political."
Excellent Mr Chandrababu Naidu.
South India is so religious and So much cultural part Of India But i dont understand how n y they give vote to the muslim supporter Congress
"Arnab im from andhra pradesh and  you had scrwed him nicley , becoz modi didnt cheat he only chetaed us by not impleting the which schemes modi had given"
one of the great  knowledge leader in andra pradesh
Chandrababu spoiled ap
Traitor & backstabber
Looks like after 2019 polls Arnab cow-swamy would be tried for hate speech against minorities. Let's hope he is arrested and brought to justice. It's must for survival of secular India.
Cbn purchases 23mla*s from oposition party. And he is the dirty polition in india
Cbn is lucha. He is the theif of vote for note case. And he is the most danger person in world.
"by saying again&again ""What I am saying"" don't kill Indians,but for us as ap pupil it's our karma ,come fast by catching immidiate flight babu"

WHAT IAM SAYING EEDEMMA BONDA LAMDIKODUKU
WOREST NAAKODUKU
"No What I am saying, I clearly told PM.  I want my arse out note-for-vote case.  I am going to issue a government order where CBI and ED cannot conduct raids on my henchmen because I give all the projects to CM Ramesh and my close aide Srujana Chowdary has looted 5,7000 Crores.  He is also called as Vijay Mallya.  I also did a lot of land grabbing in the name of land pooling and started real-estate ventures worth lakhs of crores.  I also entertained Sand Mafia in AP.  I also looted some Tirupati property. I purely support my caste people.  I have kept my my men in important institutions like CVC, Judiciary, CBI where I get beforehand information.  I also have 15 luyten's media or yellow media where I control people's mindset.  All of the channel owners are my caste people and they do not write anything against me."
CBN is corrupt person
"people's are avoided him last 15 years back then People's make CM for AP Mr: ys RAJASEKHAR REDDY, 
then after ysr death in next time elections the great ACTOR com LEADER MR:PAVAN KALYAN (Atharintiki Dharedi) film hero support him as chief minister thats y people vote to NAIDU that's y he is now CM without Power star PAVAN KALYAN..... NAIDU became DUSTBIN now no one care about him because he is corrupted politician waste fellow"
"Why would Andra needs special status? it's like any other state. if a biforgation state has to get special state, all stated will go on same line which is the worst thing to happen."
M/s. Heritage Milk owner?
Whatever you looted from Telengana will suffice  to your 10 years budget .Why do you worry Naidu gaaru ?
I like this man.. Cool CM.. Support from TN.
Aranab is such a BJP Pimp..he doesn't want to know what the problems AP are facing. He just wants to impose anti-congress hate into people...

"CBN is selfish politician , he will not thinking about AP people.
Chintamaneni prabhakar minings and harrasing people & govt employees but he is not taking action on him.
Vanthada mining in east godavari also not control. Tooo bad .... TDP."
We need special status for A.P
Andhra will never get special status. If it goes for Congress
Most corruption CM Mr Chandra babu naidu
Arnab is seen like a drunken fox this time..
this shitty editor isn't considered about the injustice to Andhra people... Rather do bhajan to BJP
Mr. Naidu  seems to have forgotten how the the BJP went back on the promise of bringing back black money in Swiss bank in 100 days and sharing the booty with the people . Nitin Gadkari ji recently let the cat out of the bag when he told an Hindi channel how the BJP leaders were asked by their high command to give false promises to the people before 2014 election to get votes and how they now  being taken to task by the cheated people for  not implementing their promises . Professional liers !
what I am saying...... tdp... and myself are worst things in world.... say yes or no.................
Why special status onlh to ap....there are smany under developed states in northern easter India......ap has many big cities I think
What I am saying CBN broker he fuckin English lkg child speaks better than CBN broker.

"Mr arnab your acting smart, not the Chandra babu nayudu"
Jai bjp
Naidu's politics was anti Congress. That's true but so what?  BJP politics is always anti Pakistan sympathizer but they joined PDP in Kashmir. What kind of politics is that? It clearly proves that the BJP is the biggest anti national party.
Arnab Goswami asking if Naidu believes Rahul Gandhi. What a stupid question. For the moment he's opposing the incumbent government. Arnab you need to understand the meaning of journalism. Please refer some good dictionary or come to me.
Killer of Sr. NTR
CNB is very big looter in india
Good try to break the new alliance between Congress and TDP Arnab. Well appreciated your cunningness Arnab. Nomatch for your craftiness Arnab. Defenetly you will become official spokesperson for BJP after your journelist mask  is removed.
"MODI & NAIDU ARE BOTH LOCAL BROKERS OF THEIR STATES!!!?
TO SAY INDIA FOR SALE!!!????"
R u sincere politician ???plz tell me the spelling of honesty babu....
U r asking statua now ...but y u accepted special package earlier ??
Nice CM
What I am saying .... hahahahaha stupid fellow
andhra pradesh  2019  cm   ys jagan mohan reeddy. he is dynamic leader  and next pm of india  narendra modi
what I am asking.. what I am saying. there is no matter
It's very difficult to understand the betrayal mind as TDP thought BJP was their Ally since very long tm so that they won't betray..... Nd as the new state we hav to definitely with ruling party bt AP people doesn't xpect dis insult.....so we hav to go in other way to get our rights to be done.... Mr Arnab TDP just mingling with Congress to pull down BJP frm Delhi throne... As TDP doing it being in forefront AP can get all it's rights if BJP thrown out... Mr Arnab u should understand it
How can Sebab say smartest politician. He is very cunning . He fight for his self.
His alliance with Congress is worst and he hurt the sentiment of AP people . Congress done very much injustice to AP.
"He did not done any thing to AP , what he can do in national politics . It's a big drama . First Develop AP. Stop this Drama ."
CBN has great vision and hard working too
CBN has great vision and hard working too
CBN has great vision and hard working
BJP underestimating Naidu now bjp will get great lesson from south by  getting totally washed away from south
"What I am saying, what I am saying is lol worst english.if he put hyd on world map why not amaravti? He opposed special status and  arrested people for asking status. Cracksoming near polavaram. Attack happened on opposition leader Jagan."
He is the best poltition of India
"We have hope on Congress party,,,"
Long life to cbnaidu wishing you always good and success in your future plans for public
You are not a good man and not a good journalist
"Worst Arnab ,,I didn't think about like this"
"Arnab is bjp party .... chandra Babu Naidu sir,please not answer to Arnab"
CBN government in ap is really better he is silent dynamic dashing  with talents and skills with future thought capable of getting funds convince others easily solve problems with his intelligence won't accept failures has support from lord of seven hills
CBN best person to lead the opposition...
"Saying Iam sincier and doing all politics, in 2014 he acted as he is very much anti to congress for dividing state, and now he is ready to lick Congress asses,the founder of tdp ntr is pure anti to congress ths party came to existence by going anti to congress. Eppudu malli Congress mosam chesthe malli modi dash chikutada, lanjalu customers deggaraki Velli nattu veltunnadu,"
I am from Andhra Babu is cunning
NAMO - NO MORE !!!!!
Arnab sucks.
Gobar saaami
"MR.Arnab Goswami, is over smart in asking questions. But he cannot able to understand the problems of Andhra Pradesh people inner heart. C.M. Chandra Babu is answering very clearly  that Congress party already cheated. that is what he supported for BJP. Now BJP also cheating, what he can do? So he making anti BJP Party."
If AP is given special economic package then other states will line up AP is relatively rich state and should through economic prudence generate wealth for its people.If the incumbent CM cannot do it he should step aside and let other capable person can do it.
ple mr.chandhra babu naidu ple speak good English allways what I am saying  what is this mr naidu
2019 andhra pradesh public waiting chandhra babu naidu dropped at house
chandhra babu naidu English speaking not good
"Tdp can't get into power directly in Center what to then
Started forming one front 
On that congress is also involved

What's wrong in that gowswamy i can't understand"
Naidu real legend fighting for india & ap to save from lofar modi
CBN ROCKS
"Why is not Arnab asking him questions on his 
1. deep-rooted corruption, slapping.
2, Slapping of honest officer MRO Vanajakshi for sand mafia.
3.  Accountability of all the money worth thousands of crores that GVL was talking about.
4. CM Ramesh assets doubling when Babu was in power and all government projects to CM Ramesh.
5. Thousands of crores Real-estate ventures with his Kamma caste people in the name of land-pooling.
6. Jewellery and diamonds missing in Tirupati as stated by Ramana Deekshitulu and Subramanian Swamy is also going to file a petition in Supreme Court of India.
7. Note-for-vote case scam where with ""evidence""money was distributed to buy Telangana elected representatives and this list goes on and on.
8.  He always prefers special package as opposed to special status, so that he can save that money in foreign banks.

I pity if anyone says he wants to become the PM of India, because in the state of AP as of now, he will not even win an election as a MLA."
What i am saying....
Modi's mad dog Aranab
TDP  RIP IN AP
what i am saying
package Babu agree to Spl.Package for Andhra pradesh
IT VERY CLEAR NE ENGLISH CHUSI ENGLISH VOCHINA VALLU CHII .. THU.. in English in Telugu People.
"you are not Arnab go swamyai, you are Arnab Modi Swamai we think.
as a journalisst why cant you question modi ,  why you cant  fulfill the AP Bifurcation act.
you are unilateral Journalist, 
I think you are unfit for journalism , join as a Modi bajana gang.
you don't have dare to publish Chandrababu naidu conversation.


useless channel. worst channel."
"Arnab you lost your charm ^ credibility man. Bear in mind we also  have bigger voice than you.Every one in India knows your backed by BJP. I know how your are trying to corner Mr.naidu. Better you ask Mr.Modi, about the conversation between Mr.Naidu & Mr.Modi.

Don't try to be smart Arnab. I am sure You & Republic TV will land in Troubles. YOU ARE VERY ARROGANT."
CBN is 420 big cheater in iNDIA . he a drama company owner
"I am saying this genuinely that only chandrababu Naidu can build ap capital .. he is senior most , experienced, knows in & outs of politics. He can still do good if ap ppl elect him as chief minister. No one can argue but he developed Hyderabad in the 90s"
Chandra babu Naidu lanjakoduku
Mr goswamy don't say chandrababu naidu. You say only chandrababu naidu garu
"Our asset is NCB
He is balanced,matured,value based leader"
TDP Lanja
"Arnob, sardesai , all are scared and partisans of BJP/Modi. They are afraid they will be finished, if they appear even rational about anti BJP front. That makes them ask negative questions and sceptical about such efforts. Even they do not apply their minds to By election results. That why their interviews are only to please Modi, not for the value of such get together of opposition parties. CBN will prove them fools for not seing obvious."
"Anrab first listen to CBN what he is  says then ask questions and another thing you just asking about only Congress n bjp politics, it's about the  nation and people of the country you sucker first you have to understand that,  n I have answer for the your question about the trust now Congress has already lost deposits in AP. Due to bifarication of Telugu states, now their mistakes had fukked up completely now  they want to make it correct by doing justice AP now it's time to gain trust of the Andhra people by doing all the promises which they had given in the  past. If they won't full fill the promises Congress party will completely wiped out from Telugu states, it's just simple logic, Mr Arnab
Jai NTR, Jai Chandranna"
Chaiwala ko desh dega aisa hi hoga he don't deserve that chair
Mr Goswami first listen the answers of what CBN said.He is the Most senior n talented politician in india
5years Andhar predes ki echi nidi mode budeda chiter mode

This is the best interview forever....
"Chandrababu Ji, you need not waste your time with this Bastard 'son of a BJP'. Country seeks an alternative. Must resolve the mess created by Narendra Damodarlal as soon as possible and bring democracy back."
"Telengana is a newly formed state not Andhra
But we lack a capital
For that we need special status
That's all"
Mr Arnab why don't you ask BJP implement special status ??
Cbn is opportunistic
Jia andhra ...jai tdp
babu baat kuch karte hai matlab kuch aur hota hai  iysa kehte hai log. so  saab ka matlab special status nahe hai.
CBN goppalu delhi media lo kudana
420 babu
Chandra babu naidu is a cheater and backstabber and corrupt
Nobody respecting CBN
"What i am saying

Arnab not a anchor his dog of bjp
I am from Hyd CBN is best cm ....
"First arnab believe in ur self than you can believe others , dond become mouthpiece to bjp"
National Media is not doing their job. They are influenced by BJP govt.
"Mr.Arnab ,are you having piles problem,b cause you are not showing patience to allow our CM to express for ur questions.first you should have patience for great sincere CM ."
Andhra/Telangana bifurcation done as one of the main promise made by Dr. Manmohan ji in the parliament and assured present BJP Government. This is definitely deceiving Telugu people by the government.
"Arnab your BJP guy, don’t worry about him or AP, soon you will close your channel if you keep supporting BJP instead of telling truth."
at the age of 73 years... 18 hours mehnat kartha hi. Chandrababu really workholic. Hamare CM hi jo ki 4 saal mein char baar bhi secreteriate nahi dekhi..
He is a cat on wall. Political broker
After bifurcation congress ready to give SPL status to ap.but bjp play with peoples emotion and promised to ap people we ready to do every thing to ap.but until bjp betrayed ap.because when tdp become national party.
Cbn is a grate political hero
"Mr news reader ...fist lessen , after u ask qu ....... Ru bjp thothu ."
"From the beginning cbn they don't asking special status, he is asking special pakege, cbn now asking special status ap people's are not believe for cbn."
Don't be too smart Mr.Arnab(mouth piece of Mr Modi & Amithsha
Now CBN merged with the party which bifurcated the state ( It is stated by CBN ).Can any one ask CBN why he ran away from Hyderabad . CBN why you are diverting the question.
Worst cm ever... He never answers any questions....  He is a very rude person with a lot ego... Ap don't need this type of cm..
Great visionary leader CM babu Sir JAI Ap JAI India down down bjp
Arnab either listen completely or stop questioning. He is a great visionary leader which India needs. Is it not the responsibility of leaders like modi or rahul to fulfil their words. CBN delivers as he promises unlike other leaders
"Jai CBN 
Jai TDP"
save india from modi sha
Aray arnab ur suitable for to sale Samosa in railway station.
He is very respectful cm in Andhra Pradesh and he is very intellectual politician in India. he developed Hyderabad ( Telangana) like a knowledge hub. Right now see the mangalagiri village in between the Vijayawada and Guntur. It looks like a gachibowli in Hyderabad. See the Andhra Pradesh DGP beside the kaja toll plaza it's looks like a mnc company......
a PM material.....
CBN great leader
"Mr. Arnab , modi has fear on CBN who can do wonders with his visionary administration. So, he had only one opponent in india who can change the face of india. So, as he is PM he stopped development in AP so that he can control CBN. But people of AP are very intelligent and they will teach a lesson to Modi."
What iam saying Naidu is wast cm
"Yes Mr.Naidu is a smart politician since he is educated henceforth he took some good decisions over the span of his career , just cyberabad in Hyderabad is enough to prove his decision making on the contrary there are other leaders who did their diploma in making chai and pakora who took some aweful decisions off late which biased people  like you don’t even have the balls to question them ... try to be a man for a day in your life and not a bitch to someone else , your masters might be feeding you well with good quality biscuits you doggy"
Mr. Arnab you are mistaken that 14th. finance commission never told about the special status as you said
"Sir plese babu tho did nt talk with u plese,,,,o.o mosagadu,,,,,,,alla word theare lies,,,,plese undarstand"
CBN our new PM
I like this Bengali babu (Arnov) before establish Republic tv. Now a days he also started to licking bjp leaders ass.
"Mr. Naidu....A political prostitude
For his own compulsions....he can join with anybody...He himself asked, we want special package rather than special status. Now took a U turn just before election. He is the one who  praised Modi that he did so much for AP than any other state. Now took a U turn again. TDP looted AP like anything now they are afraid of IT, ED and CBI raids...."
Till now I have never seen in the country who has vision to develop Andhra Pradesh like Hyderabad (Telangana)...
"Arnab please ask him a question,is it democracy welcoming MLAs who own on opposite party symbol and giving ministry tothem? He is destroyed the law & order in for example Thasildar vanajakhi case and attac on opposition  leader YS jaganmohan reddy."
Mr Arnab first listen what he says then ask any question.u stopped him in the middle of his answer which is bad
"CBN please don't join DMK and Congress they are worst than 200 times of BJP. Why sir you are projecting I bring corporate, what about the poor Farmer's any plan of construction of Dam for irrigation , AIIMS medical service to people?"
"A straight question to Mr Arnab,
As a papular, smart, genius journal you shall clarify.
Do you think what all Mr Modi done to the state of ANDHRA PRADESH RIGHT?
Do you think the people of the AP will give mandate to betrayed bjp in 2019
Do you think that the Congress will fool the people of AP once again in 2019.
The government headed by Mr.Modi at center betrayed or back  stabed state by denying the Special status, Railzone, port, Steel plant ect what was announced by Mr Modi himself ( Building the Capital city better or best than DELHI)
He was as dictator towards the AP state by not implimenting the program announced by the out going government headed by then PM MR MANMOHAM SING.
Know a conclusion straight & fair question
Do you support the need of the hour of AP people & welcome of Mr NAIDU effort to install a people's government at center by bringing down the betrayers,
Hope you give a right suggestion, dissicions as you are smart & understand the plight of the people in the NATION."
420 CM ... He cooked his problems...  Telugu yellow media .... caste media . ..  unnecessarily blaming BJP..
CBN wast fellow
Son of bitch republic tv
CBN politics ni cricket adathadu. That is CBN...cbn mundu modi west
Arnab can you conduct debate about comen man living standards state wise. Can you compare Gujarat and Andra Pradesh. Gujarat have poor living standards. AP people lucky with CBN leadership.
"Every things in this world time, naidu's time is over. This is time of narendra modi. No more naidu., there are nothing to compare."
Very smartest politician and perfect topic diverter in India.....
Jai bjp
First you know how to talk with such a senior Politician
"Mr Arnab first u wants to take the training how to talk with others & high profile people in politicians pls it's my advice for u . 
 

First u trained well ur self come to ur job. 

Give respect for each and every one.  That is the first  & main thing. 

U northern people never giving the respect for south people.  

SOUTH people were  not coming  from Pakistan aur Bangladesh  . Pls treat us like a INDIAN s

I hate ur northern people  for this matter."
Ap have great leader CBN
only what iam saying
broke of political
Naidu will come PM and can you rule better than MODI
"This guy is a corrupt politician. He gives all the projects to CM Ramesh.  He grabs lands in the name of land pooling for Amaravathi and does real-estate ventures with his caste people.  He was caught red-handed when he was trying to buy MLCs in Telangana.  He has a dubious history of locking MLAs in Viceroy Hotel and horse-trading.  Ramana Deekshitulu, a prominent member in TTD (Tirumala Tirupati Devastanam) met Subramanian Swamy and discussed about missing of diamond in TTD.  He also stated that snooping was carried out at TTD whereabouts of Swamiwari Jewellery and dollars are going missing.  All the money BJP gave to this fellow for building the capital, he is now showing no accountability for the same.  CBI should investigate his disproportionate assets case with reference to siphoning of huge amounts to Singapore.  His party members are going to foreign countries for treatment of toothaches thereby causing huge loss  to public money. All the government project worth 1000s of crores are being awarded to CM Ramesh his own party member on a quid pro quo basis.  Recently IT sleuths even raided his house and seems to have valuable information. He has been the most corrupt CM in AP."
AP 2019 cm BABU
Game over for chandrababu vinashakale vipareet buddhi

CBN is great leader
"Firstly arnab should learn communication rules because he is interrupting before he finishes and he don't know the way how he should do an interview with CM .He is asking him In the way how police ask criminals authoritatively.He need an answer that in 2019 elections whether CBN supports Congress this is the thing required for arnab.
       Ya Congress divided the state without a proper way so people of AP we opposed it and elected BJP and even this party did the same and hence again the party who was the reason for dividing saying that they will rectify it so it's not that we have to support one party always we need to support a party which makes our state to develop so now CBN is in a view to give a chance again to congress"
Arnab u lost trust
This chief minister in 1999 showed PPT slides to bill gates and made bill gates establish Microsoft in Hyderabad.  He made bill Clinton to visits Hyderabad and promoted Hyderabad. If he is made PM of India the country will get benefited.  Congress and put his face a PM and fight.  More alliances will support him rather than Rahul
"The best alternate leader other than modi to be PM of India.   He transformed Hyderabad into a technology hub.   If only he is in a national party either congress or BJP he could have got great chances to become Prime minister , he is a able and proven administrator"
Arnab the puppet of BJP

Hope modiji will realise."
Prime minister chandrababu naidu
Kerala supports Andhra Pradesh... Modi is playing smart politics...
BJP government is avoiding south India as south india is not  there vote bank. The taxes going to central government from south india is not returning back to South India as development projects. They are pouring it North India.
Jagan reddy will in  2019 in ap
Arnab.  Your. Channel.  REPOBLIC     MODI GIFT.   YOUR A BIG. LOL....
Modi cheating. AP. LOOKING  clear. Transparent.  Andhra Pradesh.
"This worst fellow said no need, he only asks packaga,, donga na koduku"
AP deserves special status.They need help to build up a new capital like Hydrabad...CBN is a strong leader like Pinarayi Vijayan(CM Kerala).Strict powerful strong leaders... Supports from Kerala
He is very frode. Chested of ap public
"We want to special status, the BJP. government promised that time, but now BJP cheated us, Naidu sir don't believe them"
For me Chandrababu naidu is a born politician and the smartest in politics much better than modi I think he should be a future pm of India
cbn is grat cm in india
"Worst CM of Ap... He cheats, lies, plays with innocent people... In the name of fake development and betrys people... He thinks he is a Monark and doesn't allow others to question him??
 Fake promises and fake heart fellow"
How dare you to call keralites shameless
Shameless arnab
CBN is the one who accepted the special package instead of special category status and forced to stop the protests against the special status which was raised by the ap people and now he is demanding again special status after breaking up a 4 year political relationship with NDA... please know the complete political history and then decide citizens.....don't judge a book by it's cover.. and don't judge by watching one interview
"Chandra Babu Nidu ko India ka PM Banado Phir dekho India Kahan Se Kahan pahonch Jaega 
Chandra Babu Naidu is Greatest Man  and Indian PM Modi Is Ass Hole Person 
we Love Chandra Babu Nidu"
"Arnab you piece of shit . Why 
Do you do this .. to your own 
you believe ththwamassy

Why do you try to fool yourself"
Why we support CBN..he didn't ask for special status last 4 years now he is asking...even assembly gave resolution for special package and CBN and co appreciated jaitly and venkaaih Naidu ji in Delhi....the CBN is opportunistic fellow ...for his political career he is making ap as scap goat
Comedy super
"SUper English and you accepted the special package and passed a bill in Assembly Thanking Central GOVT , Finace minister & Venkaiah Naidu  and 29 times you are the one who asked to Send YS JAGAN Reddy to send to jail not anything about AP"
Fekuu bagao andhra bachao... ANdhra rastraniki pratyeka hoda ichi teerali.. From telangana settler supporting fellow telugus in andhra
Arnab is is feku supporter.. He is a dog in fekus garden!
Only one CM can or could fight with modi. No other leader in country
"I challenge Arnab, if he gets truth from this kingpin and Mafia.
He betrayed AP to the core. A liar and Cheater.
After bedding with BJP 4 years now he found nothing was done tu AP.
 Is he not a criminal?"
Super cbn

"Republic tv exposed by Dhruv Rathe

Arnab goswami is the dangerous double player of Indian media
ChandraBabu Chor hain
what iam saying... what all they spoke ...we will fill full...people are briefing me
Respect your courage and  grit and will power Aruna from Assam you took the risk and started your own independent channel man you have balls man you have intelligence and intellect and back ground information in your vast brain about history demography geography of India from ancient times to day at present please consider me as an useless upstart ionly want to update your mental data on Karnataka and andrha  ideas always thinking from my child hood kengal hanumanthayya dumb erst while cm of Karnataka chose Bangalore as capital of Karnataka reason it is sandwiched between andrha  taminadu and Karnataka  but fate as it would be has presently favoured Karnataka how now there are cries for bifurcation of Karnataka into north and south Karnataka rightly so the claims of North Karnataka  neglected and deprived all devolopment works funds going to south Karnataka  even present cm of JDS kumaru provoking n k people to separate so he his JDS of dumb wily gowda can enjoy all the revenues generated in Bangalore but ihope sense has prevailed in buffaloes milk drinking north Karnataka people they should their ground bring down JDS minority govt divert funds and revenues for devolopment of North Karnataka and coastal districts with firm determination congress is a party with divisive agenda reject them in two thousand ninteen but again ihave to reiterate dumb kengal hanumanthayya proved thousand million times better than so called smart wily Chandra babu Naidu who devolopment Hyderabad and made it revenue earning hub and handed it over to Telangana on a golden platter. And regretting and immersed in a sea of remorse ha ha ha
Chandrababu Naidu is now between the devil and the deep sea or equivalent in Hindi proverbial sense Na Ghar Ka na ghat Ka reason he is a very wily politician who put down ntr his father in-law and came up as cm of united andrha curbing the reddish and kapus and promoting only Lamma naidus and neglecting Telangana other minority caste Hindus which resulted in Telangana a neglected portion of andrha at that time raising in revolt and supported by Hyderabad I razak Muslim parties  so it was not any external making but afeud between telugus of North and south parts of united andrha inthe process congress wiped out ysr congress in so out of this kichdi baked by telugus only andrha has been bifurcated into Telangana and andrha their own making Chandra babu didn't realise when he was devolopment Hyderabad as destination for foreign direct investment that one day it shall help Telangana because Hyderabad is very much part of Telangana now this so-called astute smart politician is not able to digest the truth of the folly of his decisions and he wants the rest of states to sacrifice for his new andrha with Amravati as capital and all central money to be poured into devolopment of Amravati without infrastructure or proper back up of leading roads water electricity or natural resources it is like devolopment apalace on arocky  desolate hill and that is his mind set because he is from rally Seema meaning rocky desolate rocky region ha ha but the rest of India cannot be take for a ride by this guy chandrababu Naidu now in two thousand ninteen  his tdp may be decimated by combined combination of teddies kapus SC at and other minority backward castes hundred percent sure not me c babu himself ha ha
Bharath ke parlament ne Andhra ke baath ko nehi suna. Laanath  hey aissi parlament per.chhi chhi chhi.
The most dynamic leader of country
"Mr.Anrab first of all learn , how to speak with a senior most politician in the country ."
What I am saying... Is. .. what I am saying is..........
jai cbn
CNB is smart and seasoned.
"Cbn is escaping from arnab questions,he want to encash the sentiments of ap people before elections like kcr..New drama"
Arnab ..is another media Lafoot.
Doesn't this Arnab know 14th commission members said they never said AP can't get special status and BJP is misleading people? Doesn't Arnab know how to address a senior politician and long term CM as Honourable CM instead of saying Mr Naidu?
Chandra babu naidu. is visionary person
What arnab is actually saying is bjp will not give any help to Ap. Beacouse congress did not gave them in the past..
Y arnab is diverting issue towards rahul gandhi
This is very clear.. Mr Babu will be cleared in 2019 as CM
Why arnab could not see unimplemented bifurcation act of AP ?under modi administration people of Andhra fed up with bjp dual nature.its time to show unity of two states to cooperate at all levels.
Arnab please wait until CBN puts his points. You need to have patience..Andhra people were not only smart but also sincere and hard workers.pm modi is losing a close relationship with a pure Hindu majority state which represented India in various international platforms. Sorry modi ji you will pay price for this in 2019 elections. Best of luck CBN sir.be brave we are with you in every step.
Ye bjp ka kutta arnab aur kuch sunna he nahi chahta...
What ian saying
"Babu is now done and dusted....He is going to lose miserably now...that is the reason he is behaving like rotten egg....This will be his fag end of his political career....Jagan and Pawan are the upcoming ""Political Stars"" for Andhra Pradesh."
The great Indian joke!
Such a troll you are cbn
CNB is visionary.
God know what he wants to portray himself !!
Mr.Arnab .....ji..there is CBN not an ordinary person.....
I Love Inida but CBN is cunning fellow
Drama actor Babu.....worst politician..
"Center Govt  is unFair with u  Sir AP CM  
Modi is only only Dunga"
"LOL! Congress bifurcated the state without proper planning. Now, Naidu is crying, taxpayer money cannot be used for stupid special status concepts all across India. Naidu is joining hands with the very same Congress that screwed Andhra Pradesh what an idiot. Naidu and Congress total recipe for disaster. BJP cannot treat AP specially India needs money for river linking, road building, rail expansion, national security, agriculture..idiot politicians selfish about own vote bank."
V5
Cbn is smart sincere and also opportunistic politician. Modi never agreed for special status to any of the states. He was against it because every state will demand it tomorrow. But the government was providing every thing which was possible. Now after enjoining the power for four years he thinks that it is better to go with congress..... His decision will prove wrong once...
Why do u call a Criminal king to king pin ??
C babu what is qution what  s your answer  dont act c babu
Why should the state of Andhra Pradesh get the status of Special state just give me one reason . The next thing we know every state will demand special treatment . This is similar to reservation system in India. All are equal
What modi is thinking about Andhra Pradesh people but surely we give lesson to modi coming days
why the andhra fools agreed for bifurcation that shows that something went wrong in united ap which is going to be corrected by formation of telangana....hence saying that united andhra  put hyderabad on world map will br accepted with a pinch of salt and so will be the so called special category status.....which andhra pradesh does not deserve
"Arnab down Ur voice, CBN is truly sincere politician ..... Don't say smart"
One of the BIAS journalist in India.
Most currelted CM chandrababu in India
Modi did well for India
Meaning less....So called debate....Who wants to know...You make us to rub non-sense
jai jagan
"Now it is imminent, that  the Rayalaseema will get bifurcated sooner than  later"
Modi is an arrogant leader.let him come to usa.we will chapal mala.worst bjp govt rule in history of india.
"Mr Arnab  we know you'r supporting BJP. But modi as done injustice to Andhra that every one knows. Now he is planning to distroy AP , by encouraging  pawan kalayan and  jagan."
I am from AP. chandrababu Naidu is known as show off naidu.he is a corrupted man.now he is promoting his son pappu as cm candidate. Ys jagan and chandrababu both are corrupted.
Mr arnab u don't have manner how to speak with chief minister and u r almost trying to interpret his speech
Special status is Uncontutional It can't Be given To any State .. Bjp is Right ..  Andhra Pradesh Is developed state compare To Bihar And up or Odisha ... I support Modi
Arnab have some respect to such a powerful yet humble leader. You are baccha dont try you nasty tricks on him
Arnab seems to be an asshole
"All states like AP, Telungana, Bihar, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, all north east states wants special status.  Nobody wants to progress on their own. All wants subsidy. No one will take up issues with the concerned ministers. All wants to meet the PM only, which is quite impossible because the present PM believe in working and not in small talks and tea party thereafter. Then all such Chief Ministers would complain that PM is not allowing them to meet. What a pathetic situation."
"All i can comment that CBN doing political dramas for his next election to win. PM and CM are allies political parties, it's a drama they creating and end of the election time, central will issue funds for state, and CBN will becomes a hero and  win his next election. WHAT A SHAME."
No what I am saying...  Ha ha ha ha ha....
Wast cm Chandra babu
what iam say
"What I  am saying, You didn't develop Hyderabad!! :D You just briefed BJP :P :D"
Bledy fucker cbn
Andhar People Have No Option For The Leader ...that's Way People Selected Babu garu Only
the interviewer is shouting too much. i get his point but shouting messes up the flow
https://www.facebook.com/sumanthsunny.billa.9/videos/185085695542239/
Now What I am Saying lol
Chandra babu... A man who knows the infinity..
ya !!!!!!!!!!!!! ya!
4 Four Years gone till now  .. Can't CBN immediately in first year raise the same ...CBN Sleeping till now ...Or   CBN running govt on his own money ??? From his Heritage
Chandrababu naidu a great leader
Arnab is modi lover
"Chandrbabu naidu is a son of butch... He is a no 1 crupt, donga, arogent, selfish greedy CM of andhra pradesh.... he destroy AP economic developments employment... basterd must go 2019.... Only YSRP jagan 2019...."
Sri Chandra Babu Naidu is the best politician in the nation. The nation is needed Suh leader for the development of the country.
Arnb CBN may be next PM.... don't think he only CM
CBN cannot speak English fluently like KTR but we should understand one thing that he came from very poor back ground( He has 02 acers of Land only)
"ARNAB IS OXYMORON,CHANDRABABU NAIDU IS A VISIONARY LEADER,
HALF BRAIN ARNAB.HE HAS HALF BRAIN HE USES  ONLY HALF BRAIN.
BAD BRAINLESS ARNAB."
Like in AP we have 10 yellow channels working day and night for cbn.... This channel works for saffron.Those who don't do any works keep all there paisa on media channels to do there bhajans.
Super Arnab ji You Slapped CBN with your Slippers
Usaravelli cbn
Naidu the robber The cheater
Ekkada kuda dabba koduthunavv gaa raa babbu gaa bolli baabu gaaa
CBN great leader
Maya mosam curruption babu
Good arnab
"40 year Prithvi Naidu : What I am saying. He briefed me on phone.We will pay you in to your account for no confidence motion.We will honor what ever discussed by Revanth Reddy.

Now what am I saying.I loot Tirupathi Jewels and use it for next elections.What all money you need I pay cash for votes.

Now what am I saying.Scamula Naidu."
great CM
"CBN is an open lier, back stabber ( Back stabbed his own Father-in-law, forcefully took the CM chair from Father-in-Law(NTR), NTR died because of this. Indirectly he killed his own Father-in-law). He should never be believed."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2YRD_rqcZg
"I'm from Telangana and I do support Andhra Pradesh special status. we Telugu people divided politically.we keeping our relationship
Ap special status is now sensible it can't be avoid any circumstances."
Republic is so saffron that even their logo is saffron
Chutiya Chandra Babu
Genius Chandrababu
"See the reaction of Arnab when Naidu was continuously saying  ""He is not a smart politician but a sincere politician""

The funnier line is ""What I am saying"" ""what I am saying"""
This modi chai Wala is biggest lier
centre gave around 5000 crore in totall but this Naidu didn't delivered any good work so obviously BJP has every right to not give any special status without getting any good work outcome for money given to naidu ..
Arnab with an arrogant and sinister looks
Naidu sir you degraded yourself by participating in discussion with Gornab
Bjp & tdp are not giving details about the funds released babu desided to contest single in elections by showing bjp as cheater & bjp not giving any assurence about the special satus so ultimately both parties will lost faith in the hearts of andhra people  so ultimately jagan party  will gain the election no development done by tdp
"No leader in India is as visionary as Chandra Babu Naidu, He work for people with a furthest foresight which normal public can't understand. He is a dynamic leader & If BJP thinks it can ignore Naidu & go with other parties in AP then BJP will lick floor and thumped down by the people of AP. Pls Arnab have some respect for senior leader and behave properly."
Cbn 420 came 29 times to Delhi when you are arresting jagan Mohan reddy and about his court stays not for public or state purpose he is useless fellow across the country he does not have credibility and he never win singly elections at any time???
#Chandrababu will become Next PM of IND.
arnob most irritating piece of biased crap!! watching him jus makes a person become insane :/
Naidu fheku
"I think AP people should have voted Congress after the bifurcation keeping their anger apart. Congress bifurcated the state by stating special status. Obviously if they formed government, they would have done something regarding the special status because if they didn't provide they would not come to power ever again. This is just my thinking.Dont think that I'm blaming AP people. I love them and demand special status."
Answer questions straightly sir .. why always what i am saying .. what im saying
what i am saying
7:32 ....super reply by CBM
THIS FELLOW NAIDU has prime ministerial ambitions.he is a trickster....he walked out of BJP fold on flimsy reasons.THE REVENUE COLLECTED IN THIRUPATHI [TTD ] TO THE TUNES OF HUNDRERDS OF CRORES IS ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BUILD ten ANDRHA PRADESHS.....why should he be asking the centre for special status.?
"Babu, biggest fraud ...loot more from Tirupati and convert more in Godavari district."
at present Pawan Kalyan is powerful leader in Andra pradesh
Cbn is not answering in straight way ...
What i am saying?.....
Cbn is biggest cheater in ap ever
Cbn betrayed ap people and didnot fight for special status meanwhile he accepted special package....
Arnab should give respect to Cbn. He shouldn't interrupt while Cbn is speaking.
Verbal loose motions arnab is suffering from
You will repent your wish of having cbn as cm of up .the best traitor and man of double standards.
Mr naidu now the time to change ur decission if u believe India is democratic country u have to join secular party's in india
"Give some respect to senior most politician and honorable CM..the way you give your respect to your BJP sponsors..Mr. GoSwami, Do you think he is your assistant ?? ... SINCERELY REQUEST YOU TO SHOW SOME RESPECT"
"He is corrupted cm, now he awakes and fighting  for status ,what a joke,"
What I'm saying.. Pls switch the channel
"Hello mr report, pleae mind your way of speaking to our cm ."
"chandra babu nayudu 
Super"
Why arnab you are asking straight questions...like our Telugu yellow media u should bajana to cbn
"BJP RIP.. Modi behaving like of PM of Gujarat.. He is taking all funds to Dholero and GIFT cities(google for more info)..  He will tell unity of India in words but not at funds allocation... Modi is best example for worst PM of India. Fuel hikes, GST, Demonitization, bring back black money are his failures.."
This time the development is only for his caste and his kin but not to the normal people since last 4 years and in the last year now he is spending a lot of money's for his meetings and talks all sort of things but doing nothing in the state
"Mr. AG  don't shout man speak, i remember people fighting on streets in my childhood when I hear you, best you hear all your interviews daily for 5 hrs in a day then you will improve, i expect more professionalism from you that's it, anyway it's up to you"
Arnab=bjp
"Since from the past I am seeing that CBN is a great leader but I do not agree for that because development does not belongs to Hyderabad or Amaravathi,it belongs to whole state.This CBN does not have any vision and he behaves like a nursery kid.
He gives much priority to his grant child,by birth he got much property although he couldn't speak properly,in the past he had 2 Acer's of land but today he had much property which is an unbelievable thing.
Compared to CBN our pm is good, because intially he told that he will give special status but AP cm disagreed for that and he asked for special package and again our cm changed his mind by keeping the future elections,just for cm chair and he used to protest like we want special status..
The one of the most worst cm in India is CBN...he doesn't give the respect for the pupils who voted for him.
His ruling is like of Hitler...
Most selfish guy,wasted a lot of money for his personal use like meetings, chartered flight,to his home town and investment town Singapore.
As u born like a human think a lot and do development for whole state rather than Amaravathi.
There is no use by using heavy construction and heavy building,there should be a good service.
We can provide services to ap through tent houses also.
I think all AP pupils are Buffon's including me because I voted for u,this is because by seeing ur experience I have voted and in upcoming elections I will vote for nota.
My question is that y should we pay the tax for the government because we worked a lot through day and night away from homes without proper food and  without good circumstances and that we are giving a commission for the government and I think it is not good."
cbn Oka pedda Donga
Wow! CBN is so patient when Arnab is shouting like an ass
This guy support be in the vegetable market .....
CBN lost his mind ..ap status..just see his ststements . he is like usaravalli...he is good administrster than politician|
What I am saying CM he talks only what I'm saying
"AP CM NAIDU HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING FOR AGRICULTURE TILL ALREADY 4YRS OVER, NO PRICE CROPS WHAT EVER AGRICULTURE CULTIVATED, HE IS A BIG LIER AND CHEATER. HE ALWAYS TELL TO THE PUBLIC LIE TO BRAINWASH TO POOR PEOPLE OF ENTIRE AP. WE REALLY DON'T  WANT HIM.. GOVT EMPLOYEES TAKING BRIBE FROM PUNE TO HEAD OF THE OFFICER , DIRECTLY THEY ARE ASKING BRIBE TO THE POOR PEOPLES,  WE  WANT SPECIAL STATUS, BUT HE FAILED , SIMPLY HE IS LYING, NOW NOW HE SCOLDING TO BJP BUT PAST 4YRS  DOES HE SLEEPING, DON'T YOU HAVE SHAME RA BOLLIGA , ARE YOU SINCERE POLITICIAN? VERY DISGUSTING TO HERE... FUCKOFF MAN."

Jai cbn
CBN waste cm of AP  ... in 2019 AP people won't trust TDP ...
WHAT I AM SAYING is majority of people from AP saying that most corrupted CM they have ever seen.
"Republic tv please understand the importance of great leader like CBN, and if you don't believe my words then read all the comments of the every viewer, and their massive respect to chandrababu naidu, and just compare this single interview views with all your other video views. 
please be advised that special status to Andhra pradesh is our right,  and BJP cheated us for not even implementing bifurcation act when our state was divided into two pieces by your so called Congress and BJP leaders, and media houses. 
Andhra pradesh used to be one of the richest state in the country, and ever since greedy politicians from Congress and BJP divided our state, there is a lot of revenue deficit to our state, and all the income went to telangana. 
please understand our pain, and respect a senior great leader Chandrababu naidu."
"BJP you betrayed the people of Andhra pradesh by not giving special status, and BJP don't you have any shame for not even implementing bifurcation act???"
"Chandrababu naidu is the pride of Andhra pradesh, and because of CBN there is a great Hyderabad city."
Arnab ji... i felt this interview as a Very unbiased and neutral... You just did what an honest Journalist do... Perfect questions and I love the way they are answered by my beloved CM of Andra.. Mr Chandra Babu Naidu..
"First Mr Goswami defends BJP vigorously... If he fails, he compares it with Congress to prove it better. That's all his job. This video proves it clearly, clearly at ending, where arnab questions Mr Naidu about Congress , However Republic TV ended video before Mr Naidu's reply which haven't shown to public..."
"Mr Naidu, why you took Tirupati Temple money for government projects? Please return back all  the funds you took from the temple. So this time also you joined hands with Congress. So you are a ditcher and does not have ethics."
Arnb gossawmi is sucker.....
So is the Congress and Rahul is solution for Andhra? Selfish CBN.
Why he want to build another F1 circuit is it?  Special status for Andhra. Then what about other states? Shame on you CBN.
Heee cnb so many leaders r there ur not senior....
He only developed world he think ......ap people bad decision now we r thinking .......100% we require change
For how many days require jobs he only said once babu come every home one govt job
Arnab ask why misuse grants ......y late for capital city y temporary capital
British valla meede poradadu. Modi oka lekka? peeki avathala parestadu. Super skipping speech ....
"Arnab u and your  channel allso 
Anti  congress"
"Shame on u Arnab 
Why u take name Congress ?
Bjp not given special status to andhra?
Gandu don't take Rahul Gandhi name"
He is not talking the truth
India today is pro Congress
"Arnab should become spokespersons for BJP, he is not worried about Andra Pradesh people and their problems he is worried that Mr Naidu may support Congress
Arnab has already started campaigning for BJP for 2019 election lol"
"Arnab is an asshole as he always is.
He is also a fucking Modi bakht!"
"Surely Modi must realize A.P is a special case as it bifurcated from the main A.P into a smaller state and is dependent on Center for finances!
Modi is proving to be a devious politician. I used to think he is good!"
No no.. wt I'm saying...@@
support special status for andhra pradesh ...but not chandra babu naidu he accepts spcl package first then he took some money from centrl gov and latr he didnt give proper reciepts  so they stopped all things pls save from these dirty politics
"You better go suck some BJP balls Arnab Goswamy 
Have some respect and do not interfere when it's not your turn 
I seriously think Arnab just wants a talk show rather than a debate or discussion where you listen to a number of opinions."
why cm couldn't remove  other religious employees in ttd
"Naidu sir, please do not participate in such interviews..These tv ppl work for money and not for people."
"Arnab, learn to respect a CM. Shameless Channel."
Over acting arnab is in favour of BJP  Mr naidu honest C M  and Rahul is next P M for india Mr arnab please respect C M atleast call him sir he elder to you
"mr arnab respect our cm dont say mr nayudu ...say sir

Mr Arnab Mr Arnab Mr Arnab you must give know what to ask? Your question must be beneficial for people? You have not spoken how BJP stabbed AP?
Major caste driven CM in India..any state with such CM will never see progress in physical means(involving all sections of the society).. he dubs that Hyderabad Hyderabad Hyderabad..who holds the land rights around hi-tech city..it's his caste men who got major share
"Sir we are with you  Ap will go positive way with your experience ,next PM candidate for India"
"Mr Arnab, please don't support Gujju Villains."

"BJP sucks , modi sucks, do justice to AP."
Irresponsible anchor. You only focussed on your questions not in his answers. Hating your worst media ethics.
Congress is diving our nation in the name of bifurcation.
"You are talking to the CM of andhra 
You fool bjp dog!!"
"He is a great politician Arnab...He know on 2019 there was no place for BJP
so he don't want to collision with congress"
Shout shout.....
Give space to talk CBN and you are behaving as a child and jumping too quickly.
Jai CBN
What i am saying...
"Arnab Goswami....yes we know that u are good at English....and the way u are actually...but try to know how to deal with a cheif minister....
He is not such a fellow of ua Range....shove it up ua ass.!"
Better to change  REPUBLIC TV. to. MODI TV
Please give respect to his age he is not your friend
Arnab is the slave of the bjp
I am from Andhra pradesh but if we take special status then every state will be encouraged to bifurcate. We respect Chandra Babu Naidu but why not accept extra Money that Center is giving.
Modi is a great leader but its bit sad to understand why special status is not provided...
What iam saying ...!!!!!!! Pls don't tell anything & cheat public
Very good by Arnab ...well asked to a responsible C.M
Naidu is the cheater
"Modi 
When he is not giving  value to parlimentary in house promises

Touching modi  first step of parliment house 
Is it Drama ? 

Why this man( BJP) is very much afraid of other allay 

We want justification 
Don't care who  is in front us"
Arnab you traitor and partial towards BJP .. you are not fit to be journalist because journalism means being neutral and not to fall on one party..Going forward I'll never watch Republic .
he is a lier......
"Republic TV is a BJP government propaganda mouthpiece. The whole direction of the interview is towards the Congress and how bad it is. I am no Congress supporter, but the BJP government should be held responsible for failing to deliver on the promises made to the TDP. CBN is a highly respected leader. Arnab is a uncouth megalomaniac.

Republic TV has conveniently cut this video and not allowed CBN to complete his argument."
If he didn't give status y he gave assurance to give status such a stupid pm ad u don't know how to deal with representative of a state i wanna kick ur bloody balls fuck u swamy
In which way he is senior politician experienced politician sincere politician. He is certifying himself that he is sincere senior experienced. Why he is not ready for enquiry on 18 cases which is filed on him. Why he is acting not before me. He dont have clarity on his statements. He is no 1 corrupted politician in india. When jagan is ready to face the enquiry on cases why cbn is not ready to face the enquiry. For cbi there is staff prblm to enquire the cbn how come cbi enquire jagan with the same staff if staff is not sufficient. It is very clear cbn is managing the indian judiciary and all the depts. He is very much efficient in managing the enquiry depts.
Why the bloody hell cbn gave letter  for bifurcation on that day. How can he say that he dont know that bjp will do injustice to ap.
"Cbn is a visionary cm

"Arnab is a waste and shouter fellow

"Naidu sir you saying you did ultimate progress & took Hyderabad to international level....
Why not another city development done from combined Andhra.....?
It's clear & open that your government accepted special package rather than special status....
So it's clear fault is from the government & politicians of new Andhra Pradesh state....."
"Hello Mr.Mr.Mr. Arnab. You should learn how to give respect to others. Haven't your teachers taught about respect to you in school days? You have to speak such a way that other person should understand you properly, but you are only focusing on to show your English speaking skills. It's not correct."
Mr Arnab you should allow the person to speak his own Side. And Mr you have knowledge but don't have basic knowledge. Should learn
"Buddy Arnab, first thing.. why you are shouting like a dog in the middle of someone speaking... I am telling you man, one day if I get a chance to debate with you, you will cry for sure.. put the argument and everything aside... Why you keep on asking him the nonsense without listening to him, just because you know English... Come on man... Shame on you...!!!"

And please support a journalist who questions the political parties with out any favouris . Arnab is a person who has got a great respect from western media. Better note it"
"Mr. Arnab lls do respect the leader CBN, YOU ARE A CHILD BEFORE HIM. IDIOT."
"What about TDP NCB election promises of 2014
and Kapu BC reservation ."
Arnab clearly doesn’t know how to speak.
CBN one of waste person in ap
I am from tamilnadu... If chandrababu Naidu is declared as pm candidate I will vote for him
Arnab ko jute mare....CM Chandra Babu ne....
"What I am saying.
What I am asking."
Shut up Arnab
"Chandra Babu Naidu is a smart and selfish politician. Visionary PV Narshimha Rao liberalised Economy and tax breaks were given to IT, ITES, Pharma companies, so in Hyderabad and rest of India many new companies mushroomed. He and his  community purchased land in Hyderabad at tough away prices. MNC’s were allotted land near their plots thus they made thousands of crores of in short span. Telangana people was hurt which lead to bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh."
"Mr. Arnab, no matter how many times you ask he will not answer your question. CBN is The Smart politician in the country."
Answer his question first
"Reminds me of old Bollywood song: ""One two, cha cha cha. Mr. Naidu gir mat jaana. Yahan tumhein kal bhi hai aana."""
chandrababu was a Big Dramma for the assembly election
Cbn pls learn english
Here in ap we have media mafia help us..... From this

Most corrupted poltsian in the world
We support our cm. We want special status for andhra.....
mr naidu was best once up on atime  not now
"Hey Mr. Arnab , he is not a student and u r not the teacher to demand answer in a commanding way. Mind ur tone and way u shoot out t questions. None of ur politicians did a humongous job like our naidu. So mind ....."
Hi am from Hyderabad...I do support the special status for AP but I don't accept that honorable CM sir except HI-TECH city there is nothing you have done to Hyderabad and please don't say u developed Hyderabad very much... Hyderabad is already a developed city under NIZAM ruling...thank you and I never accept that you developed Hyderabad very much...
India's most corrupted cm Mr 420naidu
Dola tirindi
What iam saying is iam a senior most politician in the country and I developed Hyderabad. Ha ha ha ha lol.....!
Thanks for re-developing and making everything functional after vizag hudhud cyclone.I had witnessed the cyclone.I am inspired by your work and dedication towards people.Thanks again Chandra Babu Naidu sir.
Mr. Arnab you may be a big journalist but that doesn't mean that you have to interrupt a senior most politician and CM CBN.. It is not fair.. You are not respecting him. Whenever he is blaming BJP you (Arnab) are just skipping by interrupting him. If you don't like it then why did you interview him?
Idiot thinks 10 years as opposition leader is an achievement and also a kind of support by the people of Andhra towards him.
"To whomsoever it may concern,please try to imagine if these sort of revolution for the special status were there at the time of seperating the stetes there would not have been any problem.But I believe the seperation took place even against the Indian constitution.None of us could do anything.After all the struggle CBN.Garu left alone to stand for United as one State.But as alone and One Man Army,there was no support for him..GAPK..To be Cntnd."
"To whomsoever it may concern,try to believe that the so colled developped Hhyderabad and Andhra Pradesh,are happened only by Chandra Babu Naidu Garu.Especially Hyderabad is his own sweat and blood.Now someone else are enjoying the Hyd.Fruits.If This kind of all party moment for the special status for AP were there at the time of seperation of the two states,there would not have been this kind fight for special status.This way we ourselves have created the problem and blaming CBN Garu is not correct..GAPK..To be contnd"
Next pm cbn sir India
"1. Understand this is just an interview not a debate. So Arnab is not really shouting. 
2. Modi upon coming to power cleverly dissolved the planning commission (which recommended Special Status to AP) and obviously back stabbed right in 2014. All politicians are aware of this and they're just acting before public.
3. This ""Sincere"" Chief Minister is now stuck in various issues like 1. Cash for vote scandal 2. Godavari Pushkara incident 3. Krishna Boat drowning issue and many more along with his ministers. So obviously he can't ask center properly.
4. Why doesn't he release an affidavit about the funds given by Center to AP and their usage?
5. This ""Sincere"" Chief Minister once openly said that he'll hang the people who asked for special status. Why is he asking now?

My intension is to say both ruling and opposition are culprits here... I support neither of these parties..."
What iam saying.
Mr.Arnab should learn some sense to speak not to bark..........anchor with some common sense!!!!!
"Super CBN garu, you retorted nicely at 7.25min"
"Mr.arnab I thought you are a great person but you are not respecting the great lengendary cm chandrababu Naidu sir. He is the most senior politician and one of the greatest CMs of India. Don't you have common sense of respecting a person.
What are you up to now? Fuck of this interview."
what am i saying....
Visionary cm Babu
why whats the prob arnab u r congress sick
arnab u  r congress supporter
Cbn: what I am saying is
Arnab should be more polite
I am in support CBN
"Chandra Babu's point is allocate the fund which was promised to them when the state was splitted.  It is a case of special state situation.
BJP will see the resounding answer in next election for throwing these jumlas."
"CBN is very cunning leader.if  he like he will close.
if he don't like he will their family on road.

god is their one day CBN will also come on road"
"By granting spl. Status to . A. P  chandrababu, will get. Nothing  but if it is spl. Package, he can fill his pocket by producing fack bills."
But you are  now conniving with  congress  to arrase  Y. S. R. Family
"Not only smart, but crucied."
"What I am saying, what I am  saying, no body knows what  he is saying. There would be no answer  to the question."

Let's see how Modi wins 2019 elections without South indian votes
#no vote for BJP in 2019
Biased BJP propaganda from Republic TV
"#no vote for BJP in 2019
From Andhra pradesh"
"I am from Andhra pradesh
I strongly support Chandrababu
No one from my state is ever going to vote for BJP
Let's see how Modi wins 2019 without our votes"
Arnab goswami is a rapist
"Me Arnab. You clearly wanted to know that whether Babu is supporting the words of Rahul Gandhi.
I want to say one thing. The whole parliament played with the sentiments of Telugu people, mainly the state of present Andhra Pradesh.
We, people of Andhra Pradesh were never interested in ruling Telangana,but the main problem of opposition to Telangana movement was that, We People of Andhra Pradesh has also contributed to the development of Andhra Pradesh. Not only people of Telangana, but Andhra people are equally responsible for the present Hyderabad. And with loss of Hyderabad, AP will have revenue deficit hampering the development.

Now, when The Congress and The BJP divided the state, both the parties supported the formation of Telangana. My question was, if they were really committed with the special status of bifurcation act, why didnt they implemented it when the Congress had power. Every party just wants to play the special category status as its play card for AP politics.

But this is a sincere warning. Congress and BJP, Lene ke dene pad jayenge. I m the one who voted for BJP for NATIONAL benefit, But when my home state is burning in problems, what should we do.

A state without capital is like a family without the head. Now, it became a matter of pride for AP and definately will become death rope for both BJP and Congress. The parties which cant fulfill what they promise, what will they do with power.
I SUPPORT THIRD FRONT. Lets states have power."
"He is a smart,sincere,respectable,honourable politician in AP"
"Cbn trying to escaping answering Arnab questions.
Just he covering like ""I am sceincer ""."
"No, what Iam saying !!

"Mr. Arnab ji he is elderly father to our one state and now we are twins... first and ever in India one body devided into two but we have one heart and one brain...He might be so intellectual to speak as fast you and current generation...Kindly my request take on interview with our twin state elected people kindly make a note...
R M Naidu

Mrs. Kavitha
Mr. Lokesh
Mrs. Roja
Put these people together on interview you will get proper debate and all solutions for your questions"
Mr.Arnab ji as you stated smartest politician in country...We being under his leadership are proud to say he is different politician in political ferternity...My statement is irrespective of caste and I'll knowledge
CBN is a genuine good politician. im from hyderabad and he did great during his time. he should get the same support today also. and Arnab stop patronizing CBN again and again!
Jai cbn
Arnab reduce your speed to talking with senior politicians
"Can't. We will protest,Telugu people only workers. Then work for money, don't think like king."
"You lost because you are very very worst human being in the world. Andhra can't get special status. If they got we will protest.andhra people are fools. People and political party are fools, you are understate in india."
Special status on ap? Naidu can dance at bar.
I support special status for AP and MR. Naidu also.
If you are talking to senior politician should call JI after his name. Is arnab call adwani with his name with out JI.
"Congress divided and spoiled ap and people sent them out of Andhra. Not even single person is elected as a mla in 2014, like was bjp will face the same in 2019."
Most currupted cm in india..mother fucker chandra babu naidu...fuck off from state
The BJP was using RELIGION as a tool & now they are using LANGUAGE as a tool. The BJP's game of imposing HINDI is very dangerous especially with 5 SOUTHERN states. If the DRAVIDIAN stupor picks up then no turning back. INDIA may get divided into NORTH/SOUTH divide.
"Well spoke cbn ""nice reply to Arnab"""
Arnab proved himself as a kid in questioning chandrababu.
Most corrupted chief minister awards in India goes to naidu
sir could u make debate cm vs pm
In India most cheated party BJP. BJP has cheated Andhra people.
Below most of the positive Comments are written by Paid people and TDP people only
What naidu is doing ??? Arnab just ask 'yes' or 'no'.he is very smart like fox.ntr is lion.
The only leader who can face Arnab Goswami with any hesitation....
"I'm from andhra. Chandrababu Naidu is a bluffmaster and relies on his mediamade image and self publicty to potray himself as visionary. People outside of andhra get wow'ed by his power point presentations and exaggerated talk but reality is that in mid -90s he said he will transform then united Andhra pradesh state into Japan ,Korea if he gets the mandate. ANd he got 10yrs mandate, and he consturcted hitech city in hyd  ingoring rest of the state and ran real estate racket around it. As a aresult his party got decimated badly in 2004, he blamed vajpayee, modi, advani gujarat riots for his defeat. BUt he never got elected back for 10yrs. Now under special circumstances like state divison he went to the newly formed -left over andhra pradesh state(after dvision) and asked them votes saying he is experienced guy and in this dire hour of need  the state needs his experience. Also Modi supported him along with Telugu top star pawan kalyan.Inspite of all that this guy won only with 1% vote difference.His party in Telangana(which had strong cadre) completely got wiped out with no presence now. So currently AP(the divided state) is his last bastion. Once he got elected, he again started selling real estate dreams in the name of Amravati and after he failed to get any traction on that and with minimal progress, he started panicking and now along with strong regional media support is painting BJP as villains for all his failures. He is playing emotional drama on daily basis. In AP assembly he drove away oppostion. Oppositon no longer attends any sessions. Only himself and his party they spend hours on daily basis running emotional show, blaming BJP, raking in telugu emotions, playing victims, talking north south divide, instigating hatred on BJP etc. So people outside of Andhra dont get too excited. This guy's countdown has started."
Great leader
"It's clear that both the national parties are to be blamed for the present situation. CM has clarified this. So why ask questions like ""IS CONGRESS SOLUTION?"" rather support the crisis hit state and question the government?? Questions like ""INTENT OF THE BJP FOR 4 YEARS"" is useless rather invite a central minister and ask why they have been neglected for 4 yrs??
Biased questionare....."
"Babu slow ga matladu madi Telugu medium party ,,,,what I am saying"
"Typical, Arnab, anti muslim, lying to the Indian people, once again. Lol"

"Arnab licking balls of BJP as usual .
Learn to respect leaders like Chandra babu Naidu first .
Leaders like him are the reason you are sitting in that chair and ranting BJP chants ."
Mind your words Mr Arnab. Show due respect to such a senior and sincere(relatively) politician. Your sarcasm might hurt many people's feelings. I am a lay man to talk about journalism but respecting elderly people that too a senior politician and a long standing chief minister is a basic courtesy. Thank you.
Arnab pls speak to sri reddy andhra pradesh actress.
See we can clearly listen when CBN talking opposite to Congress he is listening like a child but when it comes BJP he just stopped as usual..
Now what Iam asking is
NOW WHAT IAM SAYING IS

Who froced u Mr. Naidu.. to move into a new state...? it's ur willing move in collaboration with the then Govt.

people frustrated this kind politics..smart CM and seasonal politician..no answer what arnab asked ..just time passing and himself praising...
i strongly suuport to AP for special status BJP wrong step now
"Manipulation, media management expert and no. 1 in impossible promises."
"This is new form of reservation :

SC ST STATES: UP, Bihar etc gets more very good central fund even they give very less revenue to country.

OBC states: Gujarat and maharastra  gets good central fund and give medium output .

General category states: Karnataka, tamil nadu , Keral , Andra-telangana, gives great amount of revenue to nation but gets nothing from central.

What a unfair policy by central government:
Atleast Ambedkar reservation is bit justifiable since there was reason.
This Modi reservation is totally selfish stupidity which destroy the whole economy of the country.

Central government is punishing South India for showing discipline and development.

And central government is rewarding the states which did corruption  and showed  indiscipline in following the policy and population control  and showed lack of progress.

This is very bad message for the beaurocrates and citizens who are willing to show the progress. Because they will be penalised at the end."
AP never said no to division but respected it ... atleast Telangana should support AP as telugus who else would help them? atleast they are same with no differences. No harm to anyone just help to AP.
Arnab is a slave of #BJP .. his support to bjp is evident in his interviews .. media is also managed and adjusted in this Godforsaken Country
"chandra babu naidu claims always that he has 40 years of political experience.cant he judge or foresee the move of bjp that it is not going to give special status.why the hell he nod his head at the center for the special package in lieu of special status.did he go to delhi to take selfies and give interview on national channels.why did he not  meet tamil nadu party who are creating problems  in lok sabha.why he met the parties who are already giving support in loksabha,what is the use of his travel to delhi.he wants to cheat ap people again by   showing off few interviews and few photographs.cheap tricky politician.hope this guy dies soon .thats good for the state of Andhra Pradesh."
Mr. Arnab Goswmai. You are correct. He is the seasonal Very Very Chief Minister
It's just time waste always he skip the question and say what I am saying what I am saying.....
What I am... what I am saying is..
Elementary English
Arnab you have no patience and no match for ChandraBabu Naidu's sheer knowledge. He knows what he is doing for his state.
Beware of the yellow channels and yellow papers. They are cheeters. They have lost their credibility. Their journalists are not fair in journalism. They are U turn uncle batch. Don't believe. Please boycott these channels.
But he is now a failure CM of AP
arey nuvvu sincere ani nuvvu cheppukovatam kaadu ra babu people cheppali... dont you feel shame to tell yourself always ?
"This shit because of foolishness CM ... Most experience CM took 4 years to understand BJP stand and value of special status??

LOL Babu rockzzzz Arnab shockzzz
so arrogant this news guy no respect for CM
I want special status
Tdp start with cheap politics in dehlli
"#Arnab. We respect your ideology, and also you're the living instance of journalism. But, Don't fall into Naidu's criminal intent matters. Look at him, #Most #Corrupted #Politician in the universe. He left Andhra Pradesh nude for the sake of his chair.
Let's look into the details When Naidu became an associate to #bharatiya Janata Party. The BJP has made a promise to grant us a #Special #status. 
The BJP Government is always doing correctly to the Andhra Pradesh, Soon After, Naidu went rogue and started corrupting remaining state (Telangana) MP, MLA and MLC's. For more reference, Follow the link below. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Cash_for_Vote_Scam
After this scam, Narendra Modi made clear that the BJP Government is not going to allocate the Special status to the Andhra Pradesh state. When the statement is finalized and officially announced, Naidu has accepted the judgment provisioned by BJP and try to convince the Andhra Pradesh people to take a Special category instead of #Special Status. What the reason behind that criminal intends of Naidu is to protect his chair. After that, He went too rogue; When he decided to announce the new capital of Andhra Pradesh, Instead of taking waste and free lands, Naidu chose to have Amaravathi, The criminal intent is to occupy the agricultural areas that produce three fields in a year. When Naidu announced the new capital Amaravathi, The Andhra Pradesh went shocked, and Those who have the agriculture lands in that area refused to provide properties to establish wealth. Some people argued for the grounds; some people are officially granted lands to Capital, Remaining, Naidu's party politicians taken agricultural areas with the help of thugs and Policemen. 
Naidu official announced he require 1500 acres of lands to build capital; Now it's been unexpected, You never imagine, The areas have taken by the Naidu and his politician's worth 2 lakh acres. 
In Andhra Pradesh, Naidu community people are only 7%,  Most of them are wealthy and worthful to kill and occupy that chief minister chair. #Arnab, In Andhra Pradesh police officers (Corrupted), and the government employees is living in fear, They became deaf and mute, Naidu government became the dictatorship, The Official Telugu Desam Party politicians became an ally to thugs and land mafia. For Further reference, Kindly, Look into the details. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbhP87KwDXk
Also, One of the most corrupted IAS officer in the universe. 
http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/kantilal-dande-takes-charge-as-129th-guntur-collector/article6218167.ece
The reason why I have mentioned the IAS officer is most corrupt. Because being the IAS, he needs to understand the criminal intent of everyone around him. After the lands have taken away, The IAS officer remains in silent, and not even wish to put some efforts to stop Naidu. Except that, The IAS officer supported Naidu to occupy lands. 

There are a few educated politicians in the Telugu Desam party. I mostly respect  Mr. Galla Jayadev, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galla_Jayadev
He has incredible knowledge in the business and enterprises around the globe. In any political party, If the chief minister requires an education and businesspeople to take care of technical things. Naidu has chosen the Mr. Galla Jayadev to be serving under Lok Sabha instead of industrial and IT department. Because There's no one politician in the Telugu Desam party could speak the English accent properly. So Naidu betrayed Mr. Galla Jayadev. Soon after, The Andhra Pradesh have raised a question to the chief minister. Why you chose the Mr. Galla Jayadev to have addressed in the Lok Sabha. He has experience in the throughout the global business. Naidu refused to talk and allocate the IT minister to his SON. His son can't be able to speak our Telugu language properly. Now Naidu's son is enjoyed like a prostitute in the streets of Andhra Pradesh. 
Mr. American Prostitute (Nara Lokesh).

Central Government granted some significant benefits to the Andhra Pradesh like homes for poor people and education for students so forth. Naidu has converted that projects into his criminal layer. For further details. 
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana(PMJJBY) 
PMJJBY moved into Chandranna Bima

http://www.chandrannabima.ap.gov.in/About_Scheme.aspx
We don't even have a PMKVY center nearby
http://pmkvyofficial.org/Training-Centre.aspx
In case, If anyone wishes to inherit the PMKVY center in our area. Those centers are allocated based on caste analysis (Most of them assigned to Naidu's community.)

Narendra Modi is always correct, and he's perfect. After watching and listening some terrible criminal intends of Naidus. Narendra Modi refused to be good with Naidu. I still support Narendra Modi Government and always. 

My request, Kindly, Make a documentary of Naidu's political career, and Andhra Pradesh true face. 

Most corrupted politicians in the Andhra Pradesh. 
N. Chandrababu Naidu
Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy
Pawan Kalyan

Chiranjeevi
Mostly all corrupted. I have sorted some famous faces. 

The recent report as per some honest IAS officers of Andhra Pradesh state. 
1st Place in India (Caste value)
2nd Place in India (Corruption)
10th Place in India (Education)

My request to #Arnab. We need your physical presence in our state (AP). 


Best Regards,
AP Politics"
Arnab=BJP
briefed me xD
Most cunning and corrupted politician in India
The best leader in india Chandrababu Naidu sir.
It is sad Chandra Babu naidu was forced to take this step. BJP has lost a strategic ally. The Centre should extend all possible help to Andhra Pradesh to develop and progress.
"what is this guy goswamy talking, he is a communal person, talk about the special status not anti congress or bjp, he acts like the agent, sorry about this anchor and biased channel."
"Mr Naidu is one of the worst politician in India. He is a very big manipulator and liar, as you can see he saying he put Hyderabad in world map, which is probably foolish thing to say/  He promoted caste politics in Andhra Pradesh."
He only judges for AP.pawan is more more dangerous than Jagan.Naidu sir please erase pawan n jagan from AP
Thos is a question to telugu peoples pride and dignity
Chandra Babu Naidu is the one of the world famous politician if u have any doubts search in internet actually Pakistan also appreciate the chandrababu garu because of dynamic leadership
"CBN first agreed for special package and now he has taken u turn after strong resentment from people and opposition leader..he had put political leaders, students and people in jail for demanding special status ; don't make him a hero by saying smartest...don't confuse with cunning to smartest..he fooled all people and just managing state with his media thugs..."
telugu drama party leader chandrababu naidu
"This is a classic example of fallen journalistic values.Though a journalist is supposed to report impartially,this reknowned ""Arnab "" presented a classic example of ""PAID JOURNALISM"". Arnab has to come out of his ""sensationalizing syndrome"".He needs to listen to the speaker first rather than trying to rub his own preoccupied notions onto the speakers and the audience alike.It is not Congress or BJP(please read GJP- Gujarat Janata Party)...viewers are to be given well researched,impartial views. Hope REPUBLIC TV works for people of the REPUBLIC INDIA rather than mere trying to getting into the good books of the ruling party ,whichever it is."
"If CBN demand from start must they give  Status. Last moment he take Uturn.
He only say no use special status.
We are get more than request. 

How we beleive To CBN."
I am from kerala and we support our telungu brothers
Why the voice raised after 4 years (Just before the 2019 elections) n why not in the first year itself is still unanswered
HAHAHAHA i guess everyone watching understands what Mr Naidu is saying except Arnab
"Great move by CBN sir, he removed modi's fake clothes on the streets of Delhi.... Proud to be Andhrawala.. Modi we are telling you that we will treat you a lesson in 2019 elections.. Wait and see"
Special status issue is Chandra Babu game
"cbn keeps on saying he developed hyderabad.  only his community  got developed, and before he became cm underthe congress rule, hyderabad was ranking 4 th in terms of software exports, and during his tenure it slipped to 5 th.

he sayst stockmarket fell in india after he pulled out from NDA,please someone  remind him not only in india his effect felt through out world as dowjones, europe markets, and asian markets also fell."
Chandra babu naidu is always an inspiration for us
he cheated the ntr becoming the cm
prepare for sitting in opposition
AP CM annoyed people who raise voice for Special status and did so many arrests.. As elections date is reaching Cheep Man asking again for Special status.. We all have evidence when he support and accepted for Package.. Why lies at that position which degrading the values of CM position..
What I am saying is you are not able to communicate properly
"CBN never leave any interview without telling he kept Hyderabad in world MAP. What prevented you to develop AP as IT hub, if because of you only hyderabad developed. There are well developed city like Vizag"
it will be good if Mr. naidu proposes some type of alliance by keeping his face on front . so that it is clearly  visible for people to vote for. it seems he is what our country need right now.
"If
 Rtv have any one who can understand Telugu
Ask them translate 

What type of Language using for comment
Ysrc followers

It's not acceptable in civilized society

That's their party standard"
"I support AP @CBN JI. AP want justice on special status. 
Mr Modiji one way political play never work think your self and in your BJP party no one become a PM after you."
What a funny speach CBN sir. National Front and United front government formed with Congress support only Mr Gajani CM Garu
CBN stop your 40 years industry stories. Time came for your retirement. now andhra have only 25 MP seats not 42. no one care you if you don't have numbers in parliament. 4 years Gaddi pekutonnava ? Stop Election dramas on 5th year.
2019 will cm jagan
arnab goswami should learn how to speak to senior politicians and who are elder than him.....its a minimum courtesy.......he is saying mr. naidu mr. naidu everytime.....is this the way to speak to a person who is representing a state as a chief minister........idiot first learn how to speak.....
Wt the fucking English.....nuvvu cm avvadam ma karma....
"Arnab, your confidence and energy  levels are not same with everyone.I saw a lion and cat in you..."
Bleddy broker arnab
Good questions. ...but dummy answers. ...give what is required for his questions. ...don't miss lead him. ....
Chandra Babu Naidu Sir is the future of the people in AP
"Arnab, You should ask TDP corruption instead you covered their experience. CBN should tell about why PawanKalyan blaming him also need to tell his promises in 2014."
"He is one of the senior in India, but not only person. No one can say other politicians I am senior most politician in the country. In every chief minister done some extent to develop the Andhra Pradesh, not only he."
worst language by Babu
"worst candidate  mr .naidu
he want power but   not peoples wish  
what he is doing since he got power ,  everything is for nexxt election only 
telugu people are eagerly waiting for next election to elect young leadership"
Arnab.. Naidu ke saath tere khel nahi chelega
"jai TDP
jai CBN"
"jai TDP
jai CBN"
"jai TDP
jai CBN"
"This is Stupidity of Republic TV and Arnab.
Chandrababu is clear explain about need of special status.
arnab is converting topic."
We support CBN sir
The motive of this interview is very clear... Arnab just wants to know if CBN is going to support CONGRESS out of  anger on BJP's betreyal.... That's it..... Not concerned on A.P's special status.......
it is very simple...vote for BJP....eliminate political fugitive CBN... after that demand for special status...
"Arey ""U"" turn uncle pls give the answer to what anchor is asking.. fact that u do not have answer and everybody knows about your dramas for next election (he prepared some thing and exposing the same in all interviews)
Why did you accept special package..
I am sure that one day you will tell that I brought identity to entire world and I am the senior politician in the world and know everything....."
"Maine galti se iska naam "" CHANDRABABU GANDU"" padha . :P :D"
Cbn
First person who made arnab shut his mouth and made counter questions . Unbelievable
Jai CBN
Lol I could see arnab trying to put  words in CM ' s mouth that bjp is better than Congress :D
Well answered Mr Naidu.
Huge corruption in A.p
Don't follow blindly CBN my dear sheep's mob's
"Arnab go swami I don't know whether you will see this or not but one thing I'm telling you I have mail to somany times to your channel regarding ""World Bank"" Debit India I have a mind blowing smarter resolution  but no channel haven't replying to me so pls my number 7996716234"
Bhak bhak bhak bhak bhak from host..
"Mr. Arnab, please interview a person & give some solution. But don't question them and create new problems for the people of Andhra Pradesh. Please respect the answers given by the people and at most collect the intension for people's answer. Be like yourself when you are with national media in the past...

We want past Arnab - who's question is meaningful"
Arnab it is better to you to sell Samosa in trains.
arnab i like your news
good leader
"You’re not the senior most politician in India. You’re much corrupted than Y S JAGAN. Because of you and your party men corruption caused the denial of special status to AP. 

You’re one of the worst politician."
jai cbn
what I am saying..... what political dramasssss
"what I am saying......... 4 years AC room lo kurchoni, ippudu elections ki mundhu naatakalu dengataniki vacha."
"CBN is a dynamic LEADER,we will support for ANDHRA"
What I am saying is...!  Androids(not software) need Telugu translations...can you do it for them.
"Those whoever supports here, are all belongs to one cast/community i.e. Naidus or Kammas. Every resource , job, contract, position is grabbed/ nabbed chased people who are reluctant to share/support , thanks to KCR we are separated from you. BJP is the best and only solution for all your problems, dear Android's."
visionary leader of india..Mr.chandrababu naidu
master strategist..chandrababu naidu
"42 Telugu M PS ,if u don't work together, any party will play games with 2 states."
"We support CBN

Why because

Architect Of Cyberabad

Now more than Sixty Thousand Crores Generating

A Great Wealth Creator in 20th and 21st Century"
Jai chandrababu
what i am saying ?
"In every speech from post biferication he praise himself that "" what i am saying I have developed Hyderabad"" very silly speech by a senior politician can't developed his fluency in English."
"Any politician plays it ""smart, dirty-crook"" in the telugu speaking states. They come to power by virtue of fooling people, but are not interested in any thing 'good to good people'. All that they are interested is in grabbing peoples land, mis-using women, degrading respectable people, so on and so forth. Anybody who thinks that any politician in the telugu speaking states is here for commitment is the biggest fool on the earth. If Arnab Goswami or any sincere CBI officer[s] comes to Hyderabad, I can show you [101 things] what really happens to 'people like us'!! I am sure you will go back thinking 'Is this our own India- A developing country, in which such things [can] happen to any person, or family'??"
True Leader CBN
Ha ha answer his question rather then u r self dabba Mr cbn garu... Mee smartness national levels lo kudaravu
"Keep your promised modi, otherwise you have no future"
I strongly support Andhra pradesh for special status
"Forget special status, make this man the next PM of India. We from Northern parts of India supports him wholeheartedly. Hope he leads the Third front. We want a PM from Southern Part of India. Jai CBN, JAI HIND"
We also want special status and bihar is more poor than AP
Never trust Congress if we will be part of 272 actively then we acheive our rights today what we demanding arnab bcz of majority in BJP previous pillars for BJP not seen by BJP leaders soon we show our strength wait for some time today is golden days for Modi Amit and BJP leaders that may not in future
"It is apparent that BJP does not want to give the credit of achieving special status to Mr Chandrababu Naidu & TDP. The tussle is between TDP and BJP. People of AP don't want this kind of politics, but the Special Status, under which they want to prosper on par with other states."
"Mr.goswami please change your channel name as ""modi's pet"""
Arnab goswami is a paid journalist of bjp
"We want development. UPA dreamt about winning Loksabha seats in Telangana in 2014. Their sole aim was to come to power. They must have put SCS in bifurcation act. The failure of banking system is due to the policies of UPA. We still remember the manner in which we were humiliated during bifurcation of our state. Now BJP has nothing to lose in AP. One of the regional parties will anyway support NDA after 2019 elections as the state govt needs support from central govt.                    

As a common man I feel AP is deceived by both the National Parties. Special package is also not implemented. Unfortunately 3rd front is not an alternative. UPA is not the wish of majority. We may have to see NDA again, but finally the state would be at loss. People are diverted from real issues by regional parties in the state."
"What a Typical politician is CBN, isn’t he. Blaming central govt. for everything . What was he did in the span of 4 years . He said earlier that special package is boon for AP not special status . He knows everything , he is the main culprit for this entire drama. Being honourable CM of AP, he can’t backstab his own people . This is truely rediculous and blocking the precious parliamentary sessions for this is not beneficial to anybody."
Chandrababu naidu is the most corrupt CM in the country. He does not deserve any recognition.
It is high time Venkaiah Naidu steps down as vice president and fight for the cause he fought for so long within BJP. Modi made him as vice president and all other Telugu BJP leaders are spineless silly fellows. Venkaiah Naidu ascent is becoming fatal for AP.
Miodi zindabad
Do you believe Rahul.. and CBN never answer :-)
He is unfit for cm he always cheat everyone.what he was doing last 4years .now realise before elections and saying about special status.he is always saying I am senior leader in Indian like self advertiser.
The problem was Naidu not able understand questions even though he was confusions
"Why special status for andhra?? Why not equal status for all indian states? Are people born einstens or born sania nehwals,? Why to treat specially??"
This reporter is a modi's chamcha
peoples should have minimum common sense .who told you build capital like singapore.with tax payers money ..that to how pool you peoples can think that it can be build within 5 year.not only BJP any govt not give this much huge amount to one state that to within 5 years .who told you to build in 45 thousands acres .... waiting is only the solution
"I am not very much into politics friends. I am just eager to know if some one can explain to me so that I can learn. AP is asking just what has been promised to it. Is it wrong.? I am asking in unbiased tone so kindly don't take me wrong. Let's say, AP is the richest state, then why was it promised special status and asked to get bifurcated? Should it not been told before that ""You are the richest state in India, you will not get special status"" What is fair my friends? As I told you,  I am not here to fight or argue. Kindly explain me if you have patience. Thank you"
"Mr. CBN wht were you doing all these 4 years, you are a cunning jack.. as elections are heading you started to play all these dramas, see what i am saying is shut ur mouth and be honest to the people who has elected you. U r the only senior politician in India who is cunning and the only politician people of AP not going to believe you anymore. You were caught in a case for MLC election in Telangana and ran away from Hyderabad. U were afraid of cases and bowed yourself and whole state before central government."
CBN should first stop corruption in TDP in misusing funds then ask for funds.
"What I am saying What I am saying..... This is the famous, smart, cunning politician words in 40 years political history. Self dabbaaa kottukovataanike tappa inkenduku panikiraadu...."
"By the end it came to congress, this bigshit arnab is soo concerned with them he left the main reason of the interview. Its bjp you idiot, talk about them. Oh sorry i guess you can't cz ur funded by em b**"
Paaya .. Gali motham paaya..
Chandrababa Naidu should become the PM then India will progress in better ways
Wt iam saying..
"By this debate, Mr. Naidu could not understand what Mr.Arnab asking ? or he himself hiding the fact that he would like to make a partnership with congress in future ? Very clever Naidu! I thought Mr.Naidu is being heavily humiliated by BJP leaders by nor caring him, that is what led him to propagate at National level, otherwise he won't. Needlessly say that he is senior but he could not get respect even for his endeavoured work. Could Andhra Pradesh people give him second chance !? A billion dollar question!!!"
"AP lost its capital twice. To all who oppose AP SCS, please get yourselves kicked from your capital twice and see how it will be in a new state with no capital and huge fiscal deficit. I suppose Bihar, UP etc. were also part of India in 2014, what made you not to oppose SCS in 2014, because at that time you were busy imposing unscientific bifurcation on us....."
"What I am saying,i am with you don't bother . Fully corrupted politician, broker of politics, criminal minded,he has murdered his wife father,then he become a cm,party president."
Full video of this interview was asked to not to telecast from Prime ministers office this indicates that dictator rule of Modi
Briefed
Mr Arnab why are you forcing Mr CM to talk opposite congress.The problem is both congress and bjp betrayed Andhrapradesh.
Babu is a ironleg....HYDERABAD is famous for BIRYANI..SHERWANI...QURBANI MEETHAI...AND CHARMINAR.....these r all since nawabs 400years ...what babu done ...BABU NAIDU murdered TDP founder NTR...
We respect chandra babu and requesting you to be more clear and use strong lines should attract attention of everyone about the issue
Arnab seems to be a moron
"CBN is a GREAT CHEATER. waste fellow and famous for Nepotism, corruption, etc., RIP TDP in Andhra. it was already dead in TELANGANA."
"When Ap has lots of potential to build up world class capital, then what is the need of special status, 
As a senior most polician mr Naidu u know spl status will be given to backward states which do not have productivity or hilly areas or very backward but u as cm of AP u show highest productivity of India 
THN Y SPL STSTUS"
"Naidu @ plz keep ur answers clear and point, ur very much unclear on ur answers."
support Naidu
Jai cbn
Best  cm  nara.chandra  Babu  garu   please  bjp  India  lo unnada  kuda  gudu  sir  please  all  people s   unna  mata sir
CBN is great leader.... don't fellow this bjp and modi and amith shah they are doing worst politics in India..... it is not good culture for India
What I am saying - Yes What the fuck are you saying?
Naidu did not answer the questions posed at all.
Arnab what a regard and respect I had for you.. But so disappointed to find out you're a sell out. Let your masters fix the agenda and may you keep yelling for long.. But ppl have seen through you. Nation knows
"As per statistics there is no chance for special status....
It's better to go-to with special budget from Central...
CBN knows all this things..
Bt he utilises this issue in political way...may our people will realize after 2019 elections"
Shame on Naidu's part.Only what I am saying - What I am asking.What the hell is this . Naidu is just a U turn Naidu.
Yes. He is the really smart politician and he won't let you ask any questions.he wants to show he is the best in the country and he won't do anything for public.fully corrupted party nothing is doing but they want power again 2019.2019 not is easy politics for tdp
Central as to say clearly what they want to compensate for resdual state of Andhra Pradesh after bifurcation it's should stop games
You(Arnab Ji) have got the instructions from BJP not to telecast the complete interview?
For God's grace don't ever pray God for him to become pm of India..u people doesn't know his history start looking into his background before making such a statement..he has never won on his own..in last five years he has made 29 trips to foreign to make all his 2 lakh crs worth property to white..he is mr. Lier who has two faces..
"One of the Criminal minded politician in India and he missused central funds for unimportant thing. This is the reason Central government stops funds to the state. Every where mafia in AP..Sand, land ...."
"I request all review writers to go and study his history before believing his chamelon words..he is the back stapper and he has come to power with all false promises which he has never done and he has won 2 times just because of modi and vajpayee..he always tries to intrude into people's minds by repeatedly saying one thing that ""I have developed hyd"" ""IAM a sincere politician""...the people who doesn't konw the ground reality starts believing his honey words..but lately gets back strapped as how it's happening in Andhra now..plzz don't blindly believe him as we all believed modi in last elections..both characters are one and the same.."
He may not have absolute majority but when it comes to 2019 .. under Modi’s negative wave this united front can play a key role in dividing the votes! Then with his support the govt would be able to gain a formation! This is not a normal strategy pls try to understand! It’s not Rahul Gandhi.. Its Chandra babu Naidu !
"BJP and TDP together made the AP Bi-furcation act as a big joke. All AP People knew this. Like arnab said,, How come a senior politician like CBN can not predict what BJP gonna do??, Besides, CBN has taken the Special Package instead of Special Status. Its all about power politics making AP people fools. for 2019, AP special status will become manifesto for every political party."
If u have guts please play entire video and also Tirpura's CM oath ceremony.
Republic TV only supports BJP.
"RIP Modi, RIP BJP"
why can not you play entire video Mr. Aranb?? is it order from amith sha??
"No, no. What I am saying........... He's struggling to speak."
"I did learn a lesson from ncbn, never seek undue credit all the time. Hyderabad was built on strong foundation of infrastructure and rich culture. Rather he should focus on creating a city people of Andhra is seeking rather than showing them false dreams of some utopia"
Worst PM India had ever seen..
TDP korjaa CM Chandrababu
Jai Chandrababu..
2019 india pm mr chandra babu garu
Only one purpose to attain policitical attention in 2019.....
"What's the point in the discussion about believing in Congress, Arnab?  Looks like you are promoting BJP."
"i told you he did nothing and BJP grows in Andhra Pradesh,,,,,,he is doing this coz he is in loosing side,,,"
Telugu People's sentiment will shake the nation politics . The centre needs to look into this issue more seriously
Mr.Arnab let him finish first y u r interrupting
You bloody arnab bjp worker. Y are you ranting congress.
"Seasoned leader,,  good one Arnab,, he what i am saying, one of the worst interview in   Arnab History... CTA CM <,"

JOIN SECOND FREEDOM FIGHTERS POLITICAL ORGANIZATION INDIA

"What am saying, what saying why Naidu is using this line in every answer in every interview"
"4.46 its nt hanger its anger

naidu is a cheater he is da one who is reason for sr.ntr death"
Modi cheated Andrhapradesh
Jai CBN.... Best CM in India forever
Why you are uploading only your voice. We are here to hear the politicians voice not yours arnab
After enjoying the power for four years u are trying to fool the people of AP. People are far more clever than you. Get ready to face the heat
CBN is a good CM in india...always he thought for future....toooooo hard worker

Good opinions but he still hasn't stopped saying ' what am saying'.!
"He is one of most correptionist in india, be careful with CBN he can also manage ur chnnel with black mny"
Jai Cbn
RIP bjp
No.1 waste CM
Brahmins are anti telugu anti TDP..They only vote for BJP..Even after betrayal to AP by BJP they still supporting..it shows their mindset..
He is not at all serious about special status..
"From the last four years he haven't changed his "" what I'm saying is dialogue ""......."
First Arnab do not shout like that. Shouting is not Journalism.
BJP or Congress both are North Indian parties.
"Mr Arnab South Indians are not black south africans. And know how to show respect to an acting cheif minister of our Andhrapradesh. 
You always focus on Delhi politics and neglect our South.Arnab please do not loose your respect. 

And why are you interrupting him."
Naidu is most powerfull national leader
Chandrababu is great leader
Totally failure modi govt
Guys who are saying AP is not deserves special status.. How many of you servive  without heart.. Without a strong capital our state is trying to stood on our feet.. What we asking is just keep their promises alive.. CBN made a power point presentation in front of all national media.. Even after 2days why can't they release a press note like what they did to AP as they promised..
"Continuation please, Arnab you are great man.. Chandra babu pls dont believe in Pappu's party congress"
Arnab also afraid of central government :)  Mr.Arnab we are without Capital we lost Golden duck which gives us revenue.
They briefed
He developed hyderabad and made a landmark of ithub@hyderabad...visionary leader ...far better than modi
Wt am saying
Loafer of AP@CBN
a big joke if any one prise Mr naidu Presently in AP any one can asks AP public this Time TDP is not at all going to win.jagan Mohan Reddy is next cm of AP if any doubt ask AP people the real HERO JAGAN
Good leader in india
You r biggest dump reporter... Slap with chappal .. Dont say ( you )stupid reporter arnab .. d big aged man like had  any one ur northh ..indian political legand only ap cm iz besst ..am a congress voter stupid ..arnab see ur face bjp man u d biggest supporter we understand ur behavior  .. Ur parents are not teaching respect to others.. Dump face... Pop ur Indian... Am from Bharath kand
What I am saying
RIP English.....
omg he is not at all answering for single question.... coward...cheat
When shall we got special status?
Dipak basu bokachodhaa
"he neither listens to the question nor answers properly! such a great, smart, sincere and hardworking politician!!"
"I think it's time for Mr.Arnab to back again to school n learn how to listen while others were speaking, he is interrupting the CBN throughout the interview, is this is the way of giving a respect to a Senior citizen of the country. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THE SUPERIOR OF of Mr.Arnab make him to attend weekly classes regarding the Work culture Behaviour n how to respect neighbours. He is unfit for job unless he learn how to respect elders"
At least now plan your protests properly (use 40 yrs of experience)....not like wear black ribbon...cycle rally at amaravathi..
People of AP looked up to CBN when they stranded after bifurcation...inturn what he has done...nothing but blaming somebody...farmers gave away 53k acres of land ..leaving them no where...
"Dear Republic TV. 
The flood of support here we witness for this guy is unbelievable  and clearly there is something doubtful.

Please give a look into for the involvement of Cambridge analytica like companies."
"Why just prior to the next elections...it's just he wants some body to be blamed for his failure..
That scape goat is BJP..."
Basic knowledge ...no one can build a world class capital in 5 yrs or 10 yrs span. What ever money may be very little given by the central..he has used for temporary constructions...on top of that blaming BJP...40 yrs industry can't be able to realize the fact in 4yrs ...
Given another 30 yrs time as CM of AP...Mr CBN won't do anything just enjoy the power... asking public to give money but not giving single penny from his pocket..when Singapore consortium itself saying it will take 30 yrs to give a shape to the capital...the great CBN bluffed public saying he will construct in 5 yrs
"Mr CBN has been caught Red handed in ""Vote for Note"" in Telangana when he tried to buy an MLA in Telangana. Our opposition leader is facing corruption cases and he z going to court on every Friday to give sign. We don't have any hope on anyone now. I have small hope on PAVAN KALYAN JANASENA. I am requesting all national media to focus on JANASENA Because he is a better person compared to all. Even because of Pavan Kalyan's campaign in 2014 in support of TDP+BJP present government is enjoying fruits. By the by I am not a fan of Pavan Kalyan and I have voted for TDP in 2014. Let hope for a strong change."
"Fuck the show,  it's got ended with a question from Anchor but where is the answer from CBN? Let him speak and stop diverting his answer from BJP to Congress... Bla bla bla. Let him speak then judge instead of labelling him as "" seasonal politician ""
Did he told rashly regarding BJP?  so why clip got ended without showing the response from CBN"
I love cbn
unfit for cm
chandra babu is very cunning mentality we know how he killed NTR
"cbn is a great leader.. he knows, what to do.. what not to do.."
"funny comments by cbn , he has credibility by people"
Modi atulu kuda pikaleru
What I'm saying.... Chetta dash ga
CBN and his son is most corrupted in India.
CBN is most corrupted
"Cbn don't know English,better have a translator especially for him"
What season politician ?  Bloody crap. Babu cant give a straight answers to Arnabs questions but goes on and on and on sbout bifurcation and blah blah blsh blah.  Straight answers he cant give. He is an aging nut. Well he has fucked himself. Bjp knows how to make him irelevant.
Arnab sir.. it's waste of ur time.. he doesn't give answers straightly.. he is gambling before 2019 general elections.. he arrested the people who protested for special category status.. and now he pretends in front  of national media that he fights for SCS AP.. he is a lier..he is the worst politian in andrapradesh.. AP people are more smarter than chandrababu.. it's going to be a TIT FOR TAT in 2019 GE.. BJP and tdp are definitely going to loose their address in AP.. as Congress lost in 2014.. thank you Arnab sir..
He is a sucker
this chief minister backstabbed his own father in-law corrupted chief minister
Modi must throughout from Delhi after 2019 election we people already booked two tickets for Modi and Amit Shah these two criminals should go to Gujarat they can not suitable for Indian politics if these guys continue in BJP in power India will divide into two countries North India and South India
We will support TDP
@03:27 Funniest part.. Claiming credit for something that existed for 400 years..
FRAUD CHIEF MINISTER OF AP
"this idiot is looting us in andhra pradesh, he is land pooling, from small farmars, and acquiring lands for himself. so when capitol comes he and his caste members will become rich like they did in hyderabad. , show the truth media. don't give anything untill he leraves politics otherwise he will eat everything."
What I am saying  is  Mr Naidu u spoke about the status of Andhra is  equal to  package   what is the use of special status  u say about this please remember this one  but today u speak about social atatus
Shame on you Mr CM.. u don't deserve cm chair again.. we are the people from Andra Pradesh
What kind of shitty look of that anchor. Respect CM of AP.
"when did ever CBN say he is ""trusting"" congress??"
Sentiments seems to override the Constitution..
We always support cbn sir
I Think we should fight like Kashmiri people to get JUSTICE.. we want Special Status
See What I'm saying ......
Sometimes Arnab raises good points
"Mr Naidu stop saying you developed hyd, it’s already developed before India occupied. SAy true man. Learn some morals."
"always talking about what the congress has done....atleast one time talk about the betrayals done by BJP and Modi. Modiji is not even fulfilling the promises given to their own allies how can we expect him to fulfill the promises given to common man...??
#NaMo #KingOfFakePromises"
It's not TV9 ABN mr.naidu...if you raise voice ...he will rise more...
Arnab gadu modi ichina money tho channel pettadu  idi andariki telusu
I am from telanagana I support to Mr naidu and I hate arnab and modi government....
I was big fan of cbn (1995-2004) but now worst cm he is suffering with Alzheimer's disease
What I am saying is???????
So what sr.ploitician  is getting any  spacial founding in  andhrapradesh .
Richest cm in India
"Being a senior and visionary politician, y can't he guess,bjp is cheating and 40% of ap people are electing him because it's our Sr NTR Party"
Andhra Pradesh desreves SPECIAL STATUS and DESERVE to fulfill the Bifurcation act promises mentioned in Parliament
fuck
"Hi Arnab, When a Chief Minister is talking about injustice to AndhraPradesh, why you need politics in the Discussion? Did you ever covered the Injustice to AP by GOV of INDIA. Do you can dare to do it or Do Republic have balls to show the documented proof of betrayal done by Center & your loverModi. You never dare to do that because you are sold media."
let babu  speak why the arnab is diverting in case of bjp not in congress he always talks about congress and bjp but let him say the pain of AP. HE IS DIVERTING KING
Modi fail in India...babu fali in Andra total dramas jagan is next c. M Rahul Gandhi is next c. M
We want special status
"Arnab has become mental his anchoring is very worst, biased, unfit to become a journalist."
No no noo no nooooo u have to understand thatttttt...!
"Mr Chandra Babu ..why did you gave interview to Modi 's Dog . For people complaining about his English ,  please grow up . He did his schooling in normal Government school and also in Telugu medium . Yes he is not fluent in English ,so what ? He is the one who developed Hyderabad IT Industry , bringing automobile industry to Rayalasima.. and i'm sure he can develop Andhra pradesh . I'm not saying he is not corrupt  , but he does very good planning and implements effectively .

Can any one explain , is there any other leader in India/World an acquire  thousand acres of land with out spending single rupee ?

People gave the land voluntarily , taking part of land after development .

I'm fan of Modi and supported him and still i still believe ""Modi"" is not corrupt    , is it enough ? Noo....common people are suffering under him because of demonetizing and GST . Is right infrastructure in India to support  cashless transactions , GSTS?  Andhra needs some support for constructing new capital ...Andhra Pradesh is also part of India and its central government responsibility  to support in constructing  new capital like Assembly , High courts , connecting roads to capital etc etc 

Feel now relatively congress is better then BJP , BJP under Vajpayee is completely different party . It has real leader's like Advani   , Vajpayee , Yeswanth sinha etc etc even opposition party's used to respect them for there values and contributions to real democracy values .

Now BJP is playing dirty politics in Tamilnadu , Bihar etc . Dtarted with giving minister to Sevasena MP with out consulting Sevasena party ."
good goswami...ba ardham chesukunnav.......ma telangana lo full ga fuck chesi vadilipettam telugu dongala party ni..... manchi ga notlo peetav  hahaha.....................jai telangana jai telangana
"What I am saying, what I am saying..he is damn sure lier. BJP realized this ""what I am saying"" lost the ground in AP. His son demands 4 cr for each file to move."
What I’m saying is...blah blah blah....
"There's a rampant corruption in Andhra Pradesh. Amaravati is purely a real estate business in name of capital. Now they want to win elections wearing the mask off sentiments and by instigating people in the name of sentiment. Being an Andhra guy you fooled us but you can't fool Narendra Modi, he knows what can be done in 5 years as a Cheif Minister."
It is BJP in opposition during 2014 forced for 10 years and speacial status.. so why go back.. now what BJP fought for
North India focused Ruling Govt busy looting funds doing injustice to South India development
Cheeted C.M.
babu y did u agree to special package do u have sense .u have arrested so many people who fight for special status.rip tdp
"Always he praises him self.  As he mentioned, he is politician.  He want to be in power whoever come and support him, he will take.  Most of TDP party representative are outside party men.  As some of people says, cash is not available in ATM only because of Sand and Infra mafia in AP which was managed by most of TDP men."
Chandra Babu betrayed his uncle N.T.R. then Vajpayee by pressurizing early elections in 2004 and now Modi by coming out of NDA.  He is seasonal politician and untrusted leader in the country.  He won elections only because of Vajpayee & Modi twice after taking power from his Father-in-law.  All Telugu print & electronic media behind him as he is good at managing all.  He is disciple of Chidambaram and got stay from courts on all court cases against him.
He is neither smart nor sincere CM
Waste C.M
This CM can not speak english
This CHANDRABABU NAIDU IS A LIER

"Questions to ask , why ap is no.1 in curruption , why ap is building capital in good agriculture land ,why there is a deputy cm."
Cbn is a visionary  Leader..Show some respect
We are betrayed by #MODI don’t vote to #BJP PLEASE NOW MAY BE IT IR TURN NEXT
Mr.Arnab... you are a big fan Modi ji we all know that.. what do you think about yourself? Since you are Journalist you have right to justify the emotions of public rights. If u r ready to question Mr. Prime minister ask him this questions.. we are ready to support you...
"The people of AP elected CBN with lots of hope and expeteations on his experience.. he literally and utterly failed, he showed his complete experience in how to fool people and again started another cruked political plans to come to power in the next elections, so enjoyed full honey moon far last four years and he was forced to come out of the           NDA due to opposition pressure else he would have continued with NDA for next six months.. the most Unfit CM of AP, spoiled AP to the core with corruption, Casteism, sex rackets and literally raped the constituency by buying opposition MLAs and taking them into CABINET.. we have four ministers in the cabinet who won in opposition party.. all the blady idiots below praising this kind of politician as great CM in the country, no doubt BJP did injustice to the state when people asked him about it right from second  year he named them as development hinders, now he is shedding crocodile tears in the last year and putting all blame on BJP, who the fuck is going to belive this person..."
Arnab is a god damm ass hole i am a huge cbn fan.. .meet him as a part of my start up he spoke with me for 15 minutes the guy is technical.. sad he will never be the pm
if he becomes the face of Andhra Pradesh people will  doubt credibility of our demand
Maa karma Ra Baabu nuvvu CM Avadam What Iam saying
Anchor is acting more like spokesperson and negotiator from a certain political party 8:00 onwards
Mr.Naidu what's that anchor is thinking calling like that.. Attitude era
Super English
"Mr. Chandrababu, we have learnt that you are over sympathetic to Tamilians despite the fact that Tamil forest brigands are enter forests in your home district and create mayhem there and killing Andhra police officers. Also, we have learnt that Tamil political goonds attacked your Heritage factory outlets in Tamilnadu and therefore, you had to sell out your Heritage units to Future retail. Despite that you are over sympethetic to Tamilians and leasing out the land to them in your Chittoor dist and in the capital region where you have pooled the land from farmers. Can you please explain to the Telugu people, why are you so afraid of Tamil arrogance being a regional party? If your father-in-law late NTR is alive, will he let this happen? Jai Telugu, Jai Hindi."
It is very disgraceful to note that an Act enacted by parliament is not being implemented by Government itself then why should people follow all the finance acts being enacted through financial budget?
Jai cbn
Congress government only did bifurcation without concern's of people of Andhra again chnadrababu is joining hands with congress
Poor English from our c.m.. wat ever questions raised by arnab no straight answers by CBN... He is trying divert the topic..
Just all the drama before elections. What you have done these four years ? Why you havent raised ur voice these four years ?
Nv own ga gelavara babu dabbakottukoku

"This guy chandra babu naidu works only for his community(khamma). He is a joke..somebody please let that fool know that it's not his state.. It's our state.. All he is saying is ""aak is paak, paak is aak , aak paak karepak"" .. And sincere his ass.."
"Hero cbn, fighting against modi"
"Mr Arnab, please accept AP is not part of Pakistan.   AP is part of India.  Instead of attacking AP government,  Central Government has to approve SCS to AP & other promised projects during bifurcation.  Time has come all south indians hate BJP, Namo and Amit Shah."
"*APJ Abdul Kalam saying about Chandrababu Naidu
While I was waiting to be connected to the PM, Chandrababu Naidu, who was the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, called me on my cellphone. He told me to expect an important call from the prime minister, adding, ‘Please do not say no.’*"
Republic TV was the brain child of Modi
Arnab rocks
Most corrupted CM of INDIA
U idiot arnab let him speak man.. kya bich bich me baat krta hai kyu bulaya hai be.. chup baita kro
"Looks like they are only showing a part of the interview ( which is supposed to be 30 minutes )  that doesn't embarrass Modi per instructions of BJP.  The interview ended abruptly. I thought Arnab has guts but this clearly shows that he is just a pimp, I am not going to watch Republic TV ever again."
for four years things were smooth but when Jagan started asking Spl status f or AP mr naidu too jumped in to the race things may be worrying for CM as anti incumbency is a big factor for 2019
Jai CBN
Guys this is not ABN or TV9 or ETV or NTv  to listen what Chandra babu keeps on telling useless shit even after betraying andhrapradesh people for this 4years... And he should have some common sense for saying himself an experienced leader.... People should praise leaders but shouldn't have self dabba like what chandrababu do every time
Cbn is wt I am saying haha
"shut up arnab.. you dont know any thing.. you are just trying to get Viewership.. not social welfare to the address the issue.. trying to be over smart!!.. how could they devide the state without  takining  concent of the people effected. Get your home workwork right!!.. you are smart, so understand this!
central parties dont care about development! they just want power!!
they only care about support. either one party or the other!!
this is not your home town!! we feel cheated by the central govenrnment! 
Its not BJP fault, but its responcible now!! so please help the needed!! its beyond politics you understand! 
India needs sincere leaders! Try to question atleast any of your telugu staff to make you understand the issue!! dont YAP!"
"Anti Nationals like Arnab tries their ass hard to project BJP in a better plaine.,stop pimping Mr.Arnab
,If u really dare ask the centre why they didn't given special status as they promised in the temple of democracy in Parliament"
"Chandrababu Naidu has Prime Ministerial DREAMS.

He has become over ambitious and terribly greedy."

Thu ni  bathku

"My sincere advice to CBN is

Modi Insensitive towards public issues & in house promises

In Pakistan 
Court disqualified the PM 
Why not in India"
Great cm  great visionary....
What iam saying give me one more chance as a ap cm . I destroy entire ap
Arnab is paid well i suppose.. Good.
"Viewer be like  ""what I'm seeing!!!"""
"Mr arnav go and ask Modi, what he is doing with ap people??????"
Mr.Arnab is thinking himself as PM of India.. maintain dignity and volume .. CBN is the greater of greatest.. it is CBN's humbleness that he spared u
What I am saying.........
Mr arnav cbn is not smart.... Cbn is   great cm in India... Jai cbn... Jai tdp....
Mr arnav goswami first listen to the answers and then you speak to cbn. He is the best cm in India.
"Such a coward !! Under bifurcation we have been given common capital Hyderabad for 10 years and this guy spent crores on his chamber in secretariat in Hyderabad, all of a sudden this govt planned to shift to temporary capital infrastructure while spending crores of rupees sanctioned by central govt . Why doesn’t he mention that he received thousands of crores from central govt in these 4 years ? Better he stop acting before educated people in Andhra . He is just trying to cash in by bringing in the uneducated people ‘s half knowledge !!!"
How can Arnab be so anti Congress all the time and how are people expecting any actual conclusions from his discussions?
Do you believe Rahul gandhi???
Wer is the full video u tainted journalist?
"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha....
Arnab saaab...
Laal salam.....!!!"
What I'm saying is..
I am from Karnataka if Naidu is declared PM candidate i will campaign n vote for him.
He is worst cm ever
Talwachattu patrakar ya landakar..
Naidu garu is also potential candidate for Indian Prime minister position
CBN ka abhi patha chala .. special status ki liye.. ham log ka viswash nahi he CBN ka baatho par
Mr arnab First u should learn from cbn lot. Because he was great leader  in india.even PM also learn lot of visionary administration.
u can ask him any question we won't care but It should in a respectable way as he is the senior most chief minister in india
After long time I came to.watch arnab but there is something more going on between babu & bjp & also congress they all are fooling us except arnab lol...
we are expecting some bloody respect towards our cm
Babu is back.
BJP failed. Its soon going to regret
"@4.05 his looks was cunning , he is modi supporter n Amit shaw, anti south Indian anti andhra Pradesh , we are asking what you promised now we don't have capital city , we developed Hyderabad n some one eating the fruit"
If arnab intrupts on but problem exposed to national media great
"Arnab is a waste person who doesn't know how to speak to a senior politician and a state CM, he don't have the same brave to ask Modi and Amit Shah"
Mr Naidu should be the pm of india
Arnab question is straight forward but CBN isn't able to answer
BJP  ka  dalaal  Arnab Goswami  we muslim  hate u
CBN respect yakkaada ra Kedar he Arab ji i was Ur fan Give respt him first
"Mr. Arnab you have to listen before  questioning. If you just ask questions and can't able to listen, you will become a big question mark????? If you are talking about betrayal what did BJP do this term, they did the same as Congress. You tell whom to trust now?????????"
Vedi English tagaleyyaa
Learn to respect cm arnab goswami
"Our fowerful furformer babu garu honeymooned 4long years with the jumla party and lately realised that they have cheated us.babu is trying to fool the people as the 2019 elections are approaching.babu calls himself the senior most politician then who is are Advani,karunadhiand vs atchutanandan?"

"CBN licked the ass of Modi for 4 years & now to shadow his wrong doings , he going against modi looking for sympathy from AP people. Not even a single task in manifesto is implemented. AP is all about CORRUPTION, UNEMPLOYMENT, MAFIA"
nuvvu bigger thief.News said I told you sainir
What am saying mr naidu plz maintain the english translator
"Arnab, do you think you are supreme / boss of a CM if you are working for a media company ?? Please learn how to respect people & seniors & elders."
What iam saying what iam saying edi tappa enkemundi e debate lo
Mr.naidu is ap charles shobraj
Rude interview
ChandraBabu Gaaru.. Our next PM...
Am from Karnataka as I have seen situation  of AP. They really need in  special status because they have to build capital City and establish their government and governce with special funds. They are not begging at Central funds they are asking their share from taxes
"Chandrababu Naidu is a cheater...I cast my vote to him but he totally failed to implement the Manifesto, Not even a single one. When pointing at others u better check your ass."
"for every question there is a answer

""WHAT IAM SAYING'"
being a big journalist arnab doesn't know about what all promises offered for andhra? why did he asking questions to andhra cm?. Media should do ground work before interviewing such people.
modi:I will bring back bjp into 2 seats in 2019. completely wiped off.
arnab modis puppet
why to beg those assholes
modi is a talker than a doer...he only conducts meetings and praise people to fool them
"Nonsense Journalist Arnab Goswami, Don't Know how to denote a CM, Useless Professional."
both bjp and congress are shit now
"instead discussing all the current facts and real issues, our so called smart media why are you stressing on indefinite Congress words?? of course as an opposition they will be ready to use the favourable situation, hence they delivered these statement!!

BJP requested for 10 years instead 5 years of Special status when bifurcation passed in the house!! People of Andhra believed Modi and BJP's words!! later BJP promised to deliver same benefits in the name of Special package instead Special Status!! today they completely ignored the state of Andhra!! why cant you question BJP on this? 

to gain the benefit from upcoming elections, Central proposes all new projects and special funds for all those major states which is having elections - only when it comes to the Andhra Pradesh BJP says so many reasons/committees decission!! what kind of indications does it gives??  trying to put regional parties forcefully in problems??

People of Andhra are not against Modi/BJP but we demand to extend the support from Central ...We demand deliver the promises that you made !!"
asshole arnab
Arunab you need to be learn how to respect senior i love his work way...  :)
What I am saying is... I am nippu... My son is pappu....
Apart from what I’m saying wil say something......you are to the questions....for every question your answer is what I’m saying
"All The best for your State 
Very good politician Chandra Babu Naidu"
This arnab is bjp favourite
Mr Arnab Goswmai. Just stop shouting and interrupting when interviewing senior and sincerer leaders like CBN. You won't dare to do that with yogi or modi. but why with CBN?Is it because he is from south? If so be prepared for what is coming.
Best cm india .nayadu
"People respects him becZ
1.he grabed NTRS cm seat
2.used NTR during 2009 and thrown away later
3.controlled APs media and manipulated all the news
4.he just do benefits to those constututions where he won
5.he used pavan and modi in 2014 and 
6.this time as cm earned all the illegal money...and is confident to win the elections by distributing it..
People will never respect u babu...except they support ur caste as is done by ur Fellow ABN and eenadu media"
cm vest candt
In 2014 with the help of pk and modi ...he just won the electiona with 1.6 % margin...people will never respect u babu...
Ask him y his not fighted from last four years....now his doing just because elections are going to come in 2019..........pls nominate him for next year Oscar awards
Actually he is not at all bothered of special status....he just want to safekeep his cm seat...but its not possible
"modi hatavooo desh bachavooooo
naidu is next pm our india"
but he failed badly ... esp when andhra got divided..
Worst politician Indian will ever have...just for his CM seat doing all these shit things...it is he who accepted special package instead of status
Heard that this guy is the most corrupted CM in the country
BJP failed..And CBN also utter flop here..Even his STATE government ex CS sri IYR Krishna rao also wrote a book about cbn and his mistakes. CBN managing media instead of doing something for his people as a CM. He is focusing to cover his mistakes instead of doing something to his state...CBN is a  flop CM.  VERY SAD..
"@Narendramodi has reneged the election promises made to Andhrapradesh public.

"Narendrra modi ji
Hats off your culture"
"Despite the fact that Sri CBN clarify that congress did injustice for Andhra Pradesh, Arnab still asks him whether TDP supports UPA in 2019. He is sending a proxy message to TDP on behlaf of BJP making the entire ordeal look like political exodus. This is in other words called as insult to injury to the self respect of Telugu desam party. Mr.Naodu was very clear that Telugu desam party was born in the very roots of damage to self respect by then congress when Rajiv Gandhi insulted the cheif minister of Andhra Pradesh by making him carry his suit case and other belongings by treating him as coolie. Today BJP is doing more or less same thing. Till this day tdp hates congress and upa"
It's same that ncbn betraying arnab question

"Rocking CBN sir, modi will be back to Gujarth"
Jai tdp

He's one of the undisputed leaders of the south.. And you can't wait until he finishes his sentence? Diabetes or what?
Never interrupt when CM of any state is speaking.

Great leader in India
"before 2014 elections he demanded special status, later he changed his words from special status to special package , Again he changed his words from special package to special status.... who will believe him.....he is not the correct person.....

Ans: What I'm saying is...
Rahul gandhi is supporting special status and he saying that they will sign on special status if they elected in 2019. Will you believe Rahul gandhi??
Ans: No no.. What I'm saying is...
What is this yaar...
I voted for TDP only because of trust on CBN. I am not against TDP or any other political party. But why don't CBN roar like a lion??? 40 years of experience yaar.. What the hell is this... See NTR or YSR or KCR ... How they did when they want to do something for telugu people... We will support you.. Do something please"
I like Gosami under gernalist area...
"Yes, CBN is very sincere. we have Been support to him since long."
He is again foolish to day senior most politician in the country.. Not even in his party he is senior..
CBN makes his life time mistake
"He build his house with 150CR and his state had 10.3 GDP in India then why he want begg central government, all these days he told NDA is the best govt in India now he blaming NDA govt, when he went to Delhi for 29times he never asked for special category status he always asked about package and new constituencies buy mla from opposition party"
"As Usual, Arnab`s favourite pastime is to talk about Rahul Gandhi..  Rahul has his Pidi and Modi has his Arnab..."
"I think Arnab is the German Shepherd, Modi keeps mentioning about"
Ap people will punish bjp in 2019
"Where is full interview,,  this channel cut and pasted... This is not fare as Indian well wisher"
Arnab sir ..first u learn how give respect to cm..
I wish CBN was India's PM and not Modi
Modi gi you should kept your promise. .special status is our right
"I'm from Telangana
I strongly support special status to Andhra Pradesh
Let's all Telugus stand together"
Arnab please follow some media ethics and respect others...
Arnab is a shit :P............. 1st don't interrupt when  someone giving some info.......................
Same story
Modi and Cbn also waste fellows but I am fight ap special status
mr CBN give ur answers clearly there is no need of hiding ur relation with congress in the upcoming elections
"So pathetic to watch Chandrababu Naidu just avoiding questions asked.  he surely do not showcase his intelligence and expertise as a senior politician. It's so funny when he do not answer a single question asked. BTW! Like father like son. Like people like people representatives. As long as we do not change and vote sincerely, this has to happen!! And ofcos I do agree that Arnab is in favor of BJP, but if Babu is sincere as he claims he is.. at least he shud have answered the questions by not annoyingly repeatedly saying ""wat I'm saying and wat I'm askig....."""
What did Naidu did this many years
If it is possible with modi why we need to elect Naidu
CBN is very great person
Wonderful interview. We are with you CBN.
"Dear cm sir, please don't tell about sentiment, tell the necessity of people..."
"CBN Could not answer single question  straight away.  As senior politician he shoud have guts to anwer the questions straight away, instead of talking what he wants.  ARNAB called him for interview not to listen CBN's lecture but to CBN's opinion on issues concern to AP and the purpose cbn's visit to Delhi.  What a pity, the person who calls himself a senior politician simply dodging in answering interviewer's questions. A Senior politician like CBN is fooled by BJP for four years which were very precious to  AP and now he is crying wolf. The fact is Modi did everything to AP and CBN simply squandered away the money in visiting foreign countries by special flights and spending money a on unproductive things. Mr. Naidu enough is enough.  Atleast next one year you  utilise the funds to AP's development."
"arnab sir u r not understanding andhra feeling u just to divert it is a political issue, modiji u have to pay for to cheating us"
Arnab what kind of a journalist are you ! Allow da person to answer don't be in such a hurry to question and interrupt all the time .
CBN season politician and betrayed Telugu people.
"We ppl of A.P dont need spl status from central govt., unless we cant drag the black money from chandra babu naidu & family , jagan & family and few more politicians so called leaders by their chamcha followers..!!"
"Naidu babai.,pls stop the word """" WHAT I AM SAYING IS"""" u r saying from last 2 decades and we are hearing. I am not a fan of Modi / Tdp / Ysrcp. but a Indian first & Andhrawala secondly 
my direct question to you is., YTF u were silent all these years..?? y u r raising slogans now.?? wen we ppl of AP started started revolution on spl status for AP in visakapatnam beach you forcibly deceased us.now u r saying some cock & bull stories. We ppl of AP want leaders like JP sir and not a politicians like you & jagan. pls stop ur crocodile tears and bullshit."
Arnab is just a journalist who do not have any respect to any politician from any other parties other than BJP
India should have visionary PM like him..
God is with you
Why Chandra Babu had to  a cheap journalist like Arnab Goswamy?
with high regards to honourable pm and great visionary.. great leader CBN.. Modi ji pls grant special status to AP. INDIA needs Modi and CBN..
"Mr Arnab, it's waste of time to have a talk with him- he will tell whatever he wants to tell - but will not answer any questions, he will start with ""what I am saying ........"" And ""No what I am saying, understand one thing and bla bla bla"""
I am with  CB Naidu...
In 2014 he supported state division but now he is acting SMART
"Why the fuck Modi did not give Special status...Save yourself , Save AP , Fuck Congress , Fuck eveyone...What's the problem..."
100 percent you are our feature cm
Excellent speach by cm sir.
We support cbn
Change the anchor pls he is not respect for one of the honorable person in INDIA .Disturbing the any time in talks the cm talking time and also A.P CM also avoid some quetions
No noo what I am saying. ..
Arnab Goswami BJP ka kutta hai tho chamchagiri karega na
Arnab you are nothing before him and his experience.
This is only for winning in 2019 elections......Mr.CBN was corrupted for long forty years and now started a new chapter in front of 2019 elections.....he is mentioning people in every sentence while beating them during vizag protest......Don't believe him
Modi only supports to north . He won’t cares about south india
:D
i love both BJP and TDP. Please come to middle ground both parties. BJP should give helping hand to new formed state in all ways possible and also TDP and people of AP shouldnt be stubborn on just Spl status tag.
ne bondha raa ne bondha. what im saying what im asking.
This Naidu was most dangerous person.....  He lied to us..  He betrayed all oposition parties when Indian gov said their is no special status...  He only committed to take special package....  He was waste  and old politician in the caste mafia..  He only give contracts to their cast people...  He was now turning dangerous politician to AP
CBN has succeeded in making BJP the scape goat scs and not telling why he has accepted for special package when he has got 40 years of experience.
What a load of BS this CBN is talking about. Yeah he wants freebies for AP. No wonder the reservation addict population of India will support anything free instead of working hard. Fucking freeloaders.
Arey amith and modi cbn madda gudandra
TDP has intentionally took an U turn. CBN hasn’t answer the questions. He is hitting around the bush.
Arnab bjp fed dog
Wow...TDP has done a good job injecting comments from bots. Good job IT wing.
"Arnab is a partial. Modi is cheater. CBN is leader. The only thing we got for making Modi PM is linking aadhar to mobile number. Nothing else No Swiss money,
                        No jobs,
                        Unable to prove 2G scam,
                        Death politics in Tamil nadu,
                        
 On other hand Nirav modi fled the country,
                           Lalit modi fled the country,
                          Mallya fled the country,
                         2.4 lakh crore defaulted loans of bussiness men waived off but not of farmers."
Arnab cbn didn't answer your questions .. he himself prepared some answers .... Which question u ask he is saying only whatever I'm saying ...
Great leader...
apdemandsspecialstatus
BJP IS NEGLECTING PEOPLE OF AP WE NEED SPECIAL STATUS CATEGORY STATE
"Even before 14th finance commission was put in force, 13th finance commission was there in place 9 months after BJP came to power, 13th finance commission recommended special status to Ap, but why didn't BJP give special status then??"
We vote for Modi...now he showed his true colours....hate modi...Nd hate who r supporting Modi...even u arnab...
Babu endhi ra nee speech at least 40 years lo 5 years aina spoken English ki join avachu kadha
Arnab feeling like a investigation officer. Chandrababu Naidu is calm and composed.
F**k the special status...
hello Goswami i like your spoken and voice i want to listen again again and again so pls be continue.
"ARNAB,RESPECT THE MAN FOR WHO HE IS,THE LANGUAGE IS NOT IMPORTANT BUT THE PAIN IS"
Why Andhra need special status ? these regional political parties just blackmail center.
"Though far better than the extremely corrupt, crass and good for nothing politicians of North India, the  performance of Siddarammiah is far better when compared to the overrated Naidu. Arnab chutiya seems to be worried that CBN may ally with Congress and in the whole interview keeps talking of the anti-Congress roots of TDP."
Mr Chandrababu Naidu said and confirmed The Congress has committed injustice to Andra Pradesh govt. but he is also saying BJP government has also did the same. Why is Arnab only focussed on the Congress? Where is BJP in question?
What i’m saying is....!!! briefed me
Arnab is trying shift the focus of BJP failure to Congress issues  . Modi should not promise something which he wont be able to deliver .
Cheap politics
We want Bjp mukht bharath
By far the best Cm in modern India. Andhra people are lucky to have this visionary man. As a citizen from Tamil Nadu I feel jealous we don’t have a leader of this quality and genre . Good luck to my andhra citizens
Why does arnab bring congress and try to blame them when the matter is about BJP..
If you have guts please keep all the questions in front of Modiji
"Mr. Anab... what stupid question you are asking ""Do you believe Rahul Gandhi""?... it means that do we need to wait for next government to full fill the bifurcation act promises!!!"
Why is arnabs focus only on making congress look bad ? I don't support anyone but this is very suspicious
Arnab=Bjp stray dog
Bjp mukth southindia is the only answer for these cowdunks.....
"Now BJP can do any thing to get seats, even they ruin new born state, ready to abnegate true friendly alliance patries(nda parties), ready to make parliament as a fish market, they don't follow constitutional laws.  So people are not ready to vote BJP in 2019. Bjp downfall will see in Karnataka soon."
What iam saying what i am saying
All i can say is : arnab became Modi-GULAM from modi-bhakth
No....What I'm saying is .... Nobody knows....
arnab goswamy please tell to modi justice to andhra predesh
Arnab asked so many questions but our cm sir's answer is only one thing n nly one way;-) really a smart politician
Leader meaning is naidu
We want special status..... We Don't stop our war in spl status
Mr.Arnab ur a senior journalist y r u not giving sufficient time to Mr.Naidu it has to be understood by people not u
Wht is difference between special status and financial help equal to special status?
"In our country commonly occurred that is 
1) when state decide to follow mixed economy but inside followed social economy until 1991 and then captalist economy.
2) when constitution decided to rule India as federalism but inside rule is Union gvt's 
3) when constitution decided to rule whole country as secular but  inside they implement reservation for different caste 
There are tremendous problem India if we are talking..."
cbn is best leader.
"Promise is always a promise,  then only respect will come on parliament and news channels. Without evidence some news r coming in various new channels,  with evidence(parliament) news, support is not coming from news channels."
Super grateful  leader Chandra babu
"This anchor is very biased, only working for central government, this channel is not working for people, Mr.are you really not ashamed to work for money,"
"a deluge of questions ,you should appreciate the efforts done by cm for good cause primarily,"
Jai TDP Jai CBN we want special status... We want special justice
Modi +babu+tdp+congress+ysrcp +communists+janasena betrayed andrapradesh.
They didn force u to leave hyderabad...we know total scenario Mr.naidu
What I am saying endi  babu
BJP hatavo Andhra Pradesh ko bachavo
This is not a complete video
"What iam saying, what iam saying"
It is mutual stabbing by Modi and CBN but People are fooled completely
Babu is the worst c.m ever seen in India
"Yes, this is wrong to deny special status to AP. But CM Chandrababu Naidu, why you are OK from last 4 years and you mocked Y.S.Jagan for raising it during those 4 years. Now you knew Jagan successfully moved the public perception to his side and you now keeping the next year election in mind, you started as if you are fighting for it since day one. Shame Shame Shame on you. You don't have clear stand on any issue, you go with the wind and people sentiment. You are not a leader but a power hungry fake leader."
Both Modi & CBN are fooling Indians - It id shame even Modi proved to be gutless to face No Confidence motion
"Sir whole Bharat, with due Respect soliciting you, Please do not harm the integrity of the country, by the false misconception of regional politics,
Foreign mafia are already destroying the country in many ways."
"sontha dabba akkuva vundi,,,,,,,,,,"
"chandra babu naidu is stating facts. he deserves to be listened to. frankly, though i am not from AP, i feel he should be PM of India and he would bring India to great heights. he loves india. he is sincere, honest and cares for people. no one is perfect but seriously Modi govt has made some bad miscalculations. as much as i support BJP, but facts are facts. nor do i trust congress. naidu is the best CM in India. lets admit the fact. 

arnab has lots to learn to be  polished, civilised, cultured and non twisting anchor of a talk show. i feel disgusted by his attitude . i used to like him but i feel his is all about shouting and no fluidity in discussion. in the first place, its not a discussion. its a shouting show. nothing civilised about it. arnab should learn from Naidu on what it is to be cultured, honest, sincere, civilised and polished. arnab has none of those."
"BJP government only support business people ,,, BJP support  Ambani, Adani, Vijay Mallya etc,,"
"RiP English
#StayBN #CBN"
Rest in peace BJP........I.thought bjp was good party....but looks like bjp is worse than laloos party.... Looks like arnab has taken money from.bjp....
YS Jaganmohan Reddy is the spear head of this moment.
"chandra babu naidu is amn who loves the nation. he is a man that BJP needs. and promises are meant to be kept. if Modi cant fulfill this, he is losing my respect. AP deserves the special status."
Mr Arnab  you cannot  make  a  fool  of  this  person.......HE  IS  NADENDLA  CHANDRA BABU NAIDU.....
"Only because of this bloody backstabber today Andhra Pradesh suffering...when modi and venkayya naidu was came to tirupati they promised 10 years of special status ...After they came to ruling they said no special status but special package ..this bloody backstabber not responded tht time and he was said special status is not ""sanjivini""..
After central gov. Provide some money to Andhra Pradesh this innocent looking c.m used tht money to buy the other party leaders ...How shame ..almost 21 MLA 's he bought with peoples money...he always saying tht he's perfect leader but perfect leader with more than 20 stay's in cases ... Mr.chandhrababu naidu u lost the respect of many people as well as trust"
Arnab cleverly cornered CBN by asking about his stand towards Congress.. CBN could only divert the topic and did not answer
"As in Wiki - Republic channel is funded by BJP hence all this channel can do is in praise BJP'ians which happens in almost all of the debates. CBN rightly voiced the promised rights for the state AP which the citizens support but not the people in governance and giving only false assurance for want of name, fame and power only. This is not a channel for good media but paid BJP media and so is Arnab."
Superb arnab goswame
Lol Arnab can't get over Naidu....
Modi and BJP should be defeated.
"Beware of Crocodile Tears from congress, they closed parliament doors, switched off cameras and divided Andhra forcibly with false promises. khan-gress is sole responsible for this problem."
Special status andhra's right
"Modi will give great speeches, but no work in reality. Worst PM ever seen."
"All his questions are irrelevant...!!!!!!
He is well known for his madness....!!!!
Worst Arnab...!!!!   He think he is ""              ""......"
CBN is a great leader
Arnab will never listen to whom he questioned....   He keep on asking rather listening to the person.....   This happened even with CBN garu also...!!!
U turn baabu
Why the heck you're interrupting Arscloch Arnab.. one of the most respected CM in India and he is not your pet..Try to be respective  and show more honour to an amazing leader..Support from TN
In 2014 feb 20th on the floor of house (rajyasabha)  ex prime minister manmohan singh promised to give special catogery status. At that time bjp also supported for special status. In 2014 as a NDA prime minister candidate modi ji also promised to give special status. we as people of AP asking to fullfill the promises made by them and implement bifurcation act 2014
Whole nation need to special status and only Modi Ji can take ahead our country....... Har  Har  Modi
Chandrababu Naidu is one of best CM and a great leader in A.P
Mr. Babu. Why have you agreed to spcl package 2 years back and why are you making ruckus now. Just political drama from tdp and ycp. They want political mileage and making AP people Fools. No one answering about what center gave and how funds were utilized.
"Arnab should learn to respect a senior and respected politician like Chandra Babu Naidu. Where was your energy went when you interviewed Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. 

Respect to CBN for his gutsy fight against Central Govt for the people of AP."
Arnab have to learn about reality. just dont question as doubt full thoughts.
Mr.Arnab plz learn to hear Issues given by CM of a State don't politicise every issue for ur TRP and for Fucking support of ruling party.
Arnab . whatever the issue of AP or any other state.Modi failed which he shouted to covence people for votes.he didnot deserve for that ... he bluffs every one indian.
"news editors should always should be infavour of people not to the ruling parties and ruling govt,then only there will be some meaning to news"
"Arnab is sam as jinping of china, he wont listen to others during the conversation, dont act smart"
All politicians are palying with Andhra...finally...
Cbn is a corrupt politician n he was caught red handed in cash for vote n he says Modi is not the right person. I think first bjp need to investigate the cash for vote case n put cbn in jail
"ARNAB AND OTHER MEDIA CHANNELS NEED TO LEARN MANNER , C ALL MR CHIEF MINISTER  , HE IS NOT UR SON ..."
Arnab I have respect for u....but today after da way ur talking it is like ur concentrated to support bjp...but da purpose is not served....v being Andhra people finding our ways to other states for jobs....special status is our ri8 as Andhra also gave it's hands in developing Hyderabad...
CBN is really good for ap this time
"Special stuatus should be done away , but there should be temporary basis to provide help to needy states , currently ANDHRA need that help , cuz ANDHRA PRADESH has given away its capital two times . ANDHRA need that help ."
15 year cm
He is 'Sincere' politician. Only CBN can save AP...
No more modi.
"Betraying is Babu`s  style .He betrayed N.T.R ,Now betraying B.J.P   He is an opportunist ,not honest  . If  he Is he really interested in developing  in Andhra  .let him sacrifice all his properties."
National media also betrayed andhra pradesh
Arnab is clearly saying do not believe in modi.
Both the national parties betrayed Andhra pradesh
If the govt will not implement parliament act people will loose confidence on parliament and democracy
"B.j.p betrayed Andhra pradesh by not fulfilling their own demand in rajyasabha the then opposition leader arun jaitley the present finance minister ,venkaih naidu ,and in their election manifesto and in their meetings modi reiterated the same"
"Though I am from Telangana I support Babu garu., and even I love KCR to the core.. becoz of their works done to Telugu people..."
What I am saying... What I am saying... What I am saying....
"cbn garu,great,visionary leader in India.people cm please give respect,"
What I am saying is ....... what I am saying is
What am saying enti Ra babu four years m pikinav ani adugutunte
Bjp go back
Repabulic TV is completely Bjp party channel.....
"Arnap is trying hard to find to defend his owner (BJP),"

CBN great  visionary  person. He is my next cm .
Asuseual theay dont care unless we should fight like telengana spl state and tamil jalli kattu.. Unless we wont do they wont do anything.... And proud of you Mr. Cm Chandra babu naidu.. Ypu are best cm and senior most political leader in India.. Ypu are such a great leader but you should keep your eyes on villages in ap also.. And ypu are the PM candidate once upon a time..
"People of other states are getting mislead because of chandrababu's untrue statements and stupid boastings in media, showoffs, endless publicities and unrealistic digito-graphic presentations...Thanks to people of other states for having interest on AP but sorry to disclose that there is nothing being done in practical by our CM except showoff in media and internet...."
Arnab asking irrelevant questions
Arnab a fucking bitch a bjp sleepercell
Arnab is to Modijee like Sakshi to Jagan
Worst go swami...
"Do not Trust this man Naidu any more ... Arnab is correct , Naidu is smart politician .  What he is doing for 4 years .. Just woke up before elections since election are near by ..   People of AP are more smart than #naidu they will teach him a lesson this time . #UTurnUncle"
"He has been most corrupted cm since decades with media management, all media channels are paid in ap except some, YouTube tells the facts"
Is he a cm or a common politician arnab behave your self
Mr.naidu is Best visionary and administrator
Chandrababu cheated ap people
"Mr CBN what about ur promises made before 2014 elections?? U made 600 promises to people of andhra and came into power, but not even a single promise was fulfilled by u?? Is this the way a CM should be?? U know that u can't win in 2019 so u making rubbish issues... And wants to play with people, we know u are 40 years experience in politics, but U cheating people, enough of ur fake words and stop blaming Center,
Ur government cheated us and almost 1lakh crore corruption done by u and ur son Pappu,"
"40 years experience CM not able to answer the question properly, as he himself  and TDP enjoyed the AP money.Ashamed of asking for money from  people of AP to build Amaravati now after enjoying power for 4 years.He is the most cheated and cunning CM of Indian democracy so far."
Ohhh... Arnab Goswami!!!! How desperate you look when your Modi baap and unka BJPEE is in trouble.... Shameful journalism...
This Arnab Dog is shouting behalf of Modi
We proud ofthat Naidu is CM of AP and only one Man talked against Modi about Ap Special Status openly with proof's in national Media!
"Arnab question and CBN answers are not matching.. Biggest liar he is,  AP people give chance to New leader in ur state, don't vote for caste this time"
"AP fooled by CBN again,  what I am saying Lavda lavda"
Y you ARNAB interrupted CBN   AP people want sp status so demond  AP cm Jai Andhra Pradesh
Finance Commission never had the power to declare a state as Special Category State. It is upon the govt.
We Andhra people waiting for the order of our CM Chandra Babu Naidu to fight against bjp government crucially
"Mr. Narendra Modi don't abuse your power,,,,, be careful,,,,, u are playing with the  feelings of Andhra....."
Aarnab jee we know that you're a favorite journalist of bjp... Remembere that Indian people will never forget u.. But internally we apprentice your way of talking.. Plz come out from supporting bjp Mr.aarnaabjee
"Sinsiour ,Smart seasoned arnab thought CBN would fall for it.he caught seasoned word and reverted.arnab he is baap of you in word bats"
One minute silence!  Even Arnab maintaing Respect towards the leader!
"what a shamel! Chandrababu meeting all the corrupt leaders like mamatha,pawar, besides seeking support from BSP and so on.."

"vammooooooooo,,,, senior politician anta.......... idi vinnaaraa??"
Why are you always interrupting Arnab? He is CM of the state! I think Dr Swamy is only apt person to shut you up.
Andhra is big looter state... first looted Telangana for 60yrs and now crying to loot India.. beware india
Tight slaps on Arnab..
"Aarey bjp ke kutta arnab let him allow to speak ,don't divert the topic"
What i was saying correct
Drama
Arnab cannot corner mighty CBN
We support CBN and his efforts
Telangana supports Andhra
What I am saying is only answer but answer the questions of PK
Arnab is barking dog will not allow the person on other side to speak truth
we have many issues in ap after bifurcation..... and BJP or the government of India knows all that issues but they are not solving the issues as their party is nill in..... pm sir plz don't make politics in ap just like Congress..... u have seen the position of Congress in ap.... if u repeat the same u will be same as congress
"No doubt Andhra should be given a special status as promised by BJP and Congress but my question to Mr. Chandra Babu Naidu is "" what in the world were you doing for the past 4 years??"" were you in deep slumber or something???
you were busy praising Mr,Modi and Co for the past 4 years and you never wanted special status, you just wanted a package. now that you are feeling the heat from BJP, you took a complete U turn and demanding the special status. what a sham you are
BTW,  MR. Chandrababu Naidu is the most corrupt politician, there are 18 Corruption cases pending in the court and he just got them stayed in the court. Nobody buys him Andhra. Shame on you, Corrupt CHIEF MINISTER CHANDRABABU NAIDU"
most corrupted white caller politician in Indian politics . good media  management skills and lobbying skills with looted money from the poorest of the poor
what am saying what am saying haaaaaaaahaaaaaa
CBN the most deserving PM candidate ever! Such a visionary..
Mr.arnab ask mr.modiji and his companions about the promises they had given to the people of Andhra Pradesh
Jai CBN
BJP is just for votes. Nothing in action. There are also betraying TN. By not establishing cauvery management board
Beaing a bihari and hard core BJP suporter ...I support special status for AP and Bihar.
"Thank God

Mr. Arnab ..Mr.Arnab ...Mr. Arnab...please learn how to interview a chief minister...he is not your fellow colleague to interrupt in whatever way you want...Respect him first.
Best player as use and throw.
"Bloody Arnab, do u have basic ethics of journalism, let the other person speak idiot, why the hell you interrupt like a ignorant fool."
what is arnab's problem if he now supports congres??..
"The leader,,"
"Not many people know, He is the person who transformed hyderabad from rugs to riches. He lost the election finaly because there was less rural development and he focused on only urban development, but he was also charged for corruption as well. Great guy though corupt or not he made great developments."
U are sincere right...!!!! Don't u feel ashamed of yourself to utter such blunder lies with national media...??? AP people would have spit on their TV screens if u had told this to AP media...
"King of politics,,"
"If Chandra babu naidu sir will become prime minister,then we will see one new economic change in our country, and I am sure that India will play a major role in development and in technology. He knows how to use every department to bring our country as developed"
"Guys make Manik sarkar as PM of this country, definitely country will see some tremendous changes. He is one of the very honest politician in this country. Due to his sincerety and honesty  he was CM of Tripura for 25 years."
what iam saying what iam saying is no no.......good answer to every question. we should write that sentence in exam
####The most corrupted cm in India..
Some of Mental Tuglaks  saying below comment box..Andhra Pradesh is No.1  corruption  in India..u bloody monkey's that is before #Bifurcation..it means that rank got at the time of  United Ap.  Which means 2004 to 2014 ruled by Congress Govt. Especially YS Rajasekhara Reddy time. So don't blame..If u blame our state..i though u ppl R not our AP Citizens. U r non Andhra Pradesh EITHER Telangana ppl. Remember..That #Modi govt cheated us. V never forget them like Congress. Finally  i am not TDP..bt as an AP citizen i am supporting The Great Leader #CBN.
Best is Cm forever
It seems arnab has partiality.. Always trying to interrupt naidu. As a news reporter he shouldn't do that..
Mr Naidu is one of the experienced  politicians at the present . He can replace Mr Modi in upcoming years . Naidu is the only one who can equally manage both internal and external politics of India
"What this Andhra CM has been doing for last 4 years??? He conveniently changed his stand as he Caught in NOTE 4 VOTE ..He had put jail so many people for asking special status for AP..He has been cheating the people of Andhra, he works only for his BINAMIES and CASTE"
"entire nation know aranb is in favor of bjp , no single word agianest bjp neither modi , Point is very clear this bjp also have same tratement just like congress borried in grave yard in andhra pradesh , BJP is digging they Grave in Ap by betraying"
some one should teach this arnab some manners..
Corrupt king
self dabba Appu cbn
"We need Special Status, its our right."

"chandrababu don't act over smart...people know that u r the biggest actor, the most harmful, the most corrupted, the most cunning,  the biggest cheater, the most pretender, the biggest lier,  the most illegal CM ever in AP political history.."
"We don't believe CBN, it's a closed chapter now. Mr CM you should have simply followed Pawan kalyan suggestions on special status. Why the hell you accepted Special package.? That's your biggest mistake. Now stop the bloody drama for votes."
"Highly corputed cm in india,worsted cm"
What am saying......
In what way n how can u be the most experienced person in indian politics..?? There are many politicians in India much more senior and experienced than you...Stop ur stupid boasting in front of national media.... Don't speak like a clown and degrade the pride of Ap people...
Bjp down down give status to ap
"chandrababu it's really amazing that u still speak with ur shameless face....Boasting about yourself, Fooling and cheating people is the only thing that u could make and learnt in ur 40 years political career..."
"Mr arnab what Modi said at the time of Demonitisation to the nation give me few days time then I am going to show heven in your life's, we believed, but he cheated entire Nation with his mesmerized word's like that he also cheated our CM chandra babu and AP people, better you should interview the national cheater PM frist that will increase your TRP also"
"Arnab is a BJP RSS chamcha who has no concern abt Andhra issues all he wants is to create anti congress wave at the cost of some others problems, such a leech of a reporter"
u did hyderabad as a big city better you stayed in Hyderabad and Telangana ... Why did you participate in AP ???
Cbn..Super politician in the india
"""what i am saying and what i am asking ""is it a script you are reading for every question same kind of answer ....what he is asking WTF you are saying...we need simple and straight answers...ap people will make you in opposition again for 9 more years..."
He really has the credibility and also one of the smartest politicians in our country
chandrababu Can u tell about one useful thing that u have done to people in 4 years...!!! What u have done in 4 years is boundless corruption...illegal activities...jailing poor farmers...no punishment to people who hit and misbehave with women...grabbing land from farmers...misuse of law and order...spending the budget for useless things...fooling and cheating people with ur bilingual words and false promises..
What I am saying
"My only one question to Naidu, last so many years Congress was rooling central, moreover last ten years cotinousely , they were at least in that time anything they favoured with a.p. , still they are doing the are playing Same politics nothing to happened, and will worst than  NDA, especially under this pappu and team ,first e all he's a abnormal person, people have no belief in this pappu, this is what Naidu mistaken, if he want to oppose NDA better to do alone, if take support of Congress won't get support now he is having"
Today u r doing crocodile cries that BJP haven't done anything...what about last 4 budgets...?? how did u spend that lacks of crores..?? What about ur 600 false promises to AP people..??? How many promises did u fulfill with last 4 budgets..??? how many crores did u spend on useful things to people..??
Modi is busy in planning the 2019 win. Too late for Chander Babu to rebel.
Don't do crocodile cries in front of National media...AP people know how cunning u r...U praised modi n BJP in 4 years with ur yellow media support quoting that no other govt can favour AP like BJP..... and today u r blaming them...
He take ysr cp party MLS . He not a good
"No matter central government help  AP or not  , AP people are hard workers , they will be educated and   sure they develop their STATE. Don't UNDERESTIMATE     ANDHRA. Jai ANDHRA."
chandrababu...U don't have right to continue as CM of AP....U are unfit for the post...
"Mr. Naidu, dont trust Gujus. next time be careful before you trust Feku.. The PM's Promises are meant to be broken. thats is why he is Jumlebaaz."
Useless arnab Goswami
Babu learn English what im saying that anta endi edi
waste cm for ap
Arnaab is modi ‘s mouth piece! Why did cbn answer this fellow who is hated by 90% of tv viewers!
"Mr arnab mr arnab mr arnab kitna chatega bjp ki...

Awaz cbn pe hi modi aur yogi pe bi utha le."
Arnab is deviating the debate..why did Rahul gandhi came in the picture.. Its CBN vs MODI..
Modi ji we want special status
Arnab cowswamy bjp covert
Solu babu
CBN for PM
I requested to Republic TV please highlight the present situation of AP and Big failure of Modi ji please don't divert as political issue
"No state deserve special state status except for northeastern States for there development... further the division was carried out based as large segment of united Andhra Pradesh people who demanded the division to be, moreover lot of damage was done to state property at that time. It's time Political leadership look not from state prospective but from National prospective."
Self dabha
"Arnab Goswami  has a dirty habit of first posing a question to the interviewee, and then not allowing him (the interviewee) to complete the answer!!  This is a congenital flaw in any interviewer.   He should listen to the interviewee more than he himself talk!!  That is how he brought Times Now into disrepute during his stay with that channel!!"
Where is the full video?
Mr.Arnab why didn't you disturb first complete CBN answer then ask another question .
The other part has been deleted due to pressure from BJP
Hyderabad ka founder
@arnab Goswami....a sincere and obedient BJP boot licker....u try your best to highlight only the pros of BJP....1st look at the person whom you are questioning....he is considered the gem of Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh.... there's no better developing m
No.....What im saying......??????
Arnab makes himself joker...no sense...
Modi sir don't do this to Andhra Pradesh....It is very well known Politics of yours to control and vanish Babu and SHAME ON YOU FOR SUPPORTING JAGAN ...SHAME ON U MODI SIR
Watching republic TV is like going to a zoo and watching the most obnoxious monkey which has been brought from Assam... And that monkey is orange in color...
"Niku buddi raadu ra babuu, inka hyderabad edustunnav thuuu"
Chhor Chandrababu naidu
#UTurnUncle chandrababu
Ap people are very intellectual i guess modi should not have lose them
"Mr Naidu...why r u boasting soo much...plz give direct answers to the questions raised by Mr ARNAB...But, AP deserves Special Status...But its not ur cup of Tea Mr Naidu...
Its possible only Mr Pawan kalyan @ A GENUINE LEADER....JAI JANASENA"
"Sir,what the questions u have asked?he simply said the answers I think u should have done more"
"Whole Conversation is good .. But CM always says.. : What I am saying , No No What I am saying.. i think He should avoid such repeatable words""..."
"AP's capital was taken away from it... imagine what a great Gdsp loss it suffered... All the money of urban development, infrastructure projects e.t.c went to Hyderabad....

So Andra Pradesh needs to start all over again and build a new capital called the Amaravati city (which will be bigger and smarter city than Hyderabad)...
The farmers of Andra Pradesh gave their lands to build smart city Amaravati...
Honourable CM sir was relying on the Centre to provide special status so that he can get more money to rebuild a capital city or atleast some financial support."
"Senior most politician , Hyderabad map"
What I'm.saying
"Hello naidu, great exploring of hyd comes in map is because of you? This is not acceptable. And AP people are expecting status and other parties also expected but you are the person accepted package and now before elections you realised and fighting now. What the hell it is. You should fight since starting??? Not this time. 

Modi also doesn't have money how much you have. 170crores."
What he is saying is very true and legitimate..centre must give what it should as per bifurcation act and its very sad modi ji is making people of andhra cry and feel insecure as the congress did.
CBN is visionary and great leader. Really AP people are gifted with CBN.Hope more development is on the way in his leadership. No doubt a true inspiring leader.
what i am saying
#ChamelonCBN
Super
"In AP issues, all political parties are convicts (A1 – Congress;   A2 – BJP;   A3 – TDP;   A4 – YCP)

Coming to Mr. Naidu, he was changed his version number of times on special status to AP
Before 2014 elections Mr. Naidu said
          “Special status required 15 years to AP
After 2014 elections Mr. Naidu said
           “Special status is not sanjeevani “   --   “Special status is closed chapter”  --   “Special package is better than Special status”
             --  “If anyone raises the voice for special status, police cases will be filed”
Now, 2019 election fever starts
            Mr. Naidu raises voice for Special status

Being a citizen, how can I believe this kind of politicians"
We need pm like a chandrababu
According to my view....       mr.Arnab  wants to know the main view of our CM sir. Our CM sir trying to say full details to public through REPUBLIC TV not to Arnab... Our CM is most senior and sincere and Mr.Arnab is great Presenter...Both are doing correct....
Pratheyaka hodaa Andhrula hakku
"Arnab doesn't have the decency, he talking to CM I mean BJP ka dalla kahi ka"
90% of the VIEWS are originating from FAKE & FICTITIOUS ACCOUNTS......All Naidu's Media Bit Coin henchman working on overdrive mode...... ....surely must have 250K LIKES VIEW?
"What Arnab is asking what this Chandra Babu is answering. ?? CBN is not making any sense. One years back, he only said Special Status is not needed, and he arrested many people who were fighting for Special Status. Chandra Babu Naidu is a cunning politician."
CBN great leader
republic now look like rss mouth piece
"He is good Cm, but state division divided his career, now divided himself from BJP & alliance with congress, AP Public will not forget- they are intelligent"
Modiji is not currect...
What is this self promote very very very
love you Chandra Babu Naidu garu..
u r biased arnab saaf dikh raha h
Arnab first learn to give respect to senior leaders by saying sir before or after the name
"Don't raise u r voice in front of cbn,it's not debate,it's an interview!who r u to question naidu, if u have sympathy towards Andhra Pradesh,u  have to question mr pm sir"
modi will win. naidu will lose
Really sad to see... Even Arnab is played into this Paid media management... How funny is it to say that he will be the king pin in fight against modi..iam not a modi fan though. Here is a man who survived all his political career either through media management and by fooling the people or through use and throw antics..lost all the credibility among the people of AP and now trying damn  hard to test all his disgusting skills  once again on the people just to save his face.
Perplexed and puzzled CM
He is not modi to walk out of your shitty debate instead of a interview....If he had strong back on him he would have been the PM by 2014 itself..Unfortunately because of few reasons he could not make it but he is the best in india for a prime minister candidature
Arnab CBN he is corporate and smart politican
He never give direct answer to any question.He will give answer what he want tell always
"AP was promised by parliament through government Act.  Now those promises which are kept in GOVERNMENT ACT is not implemented ....4 years over...people are angry,,,,we are asking what we were promised nothing extra"
7:20.. Point to be noted.. Jai naidu
"I lost all the respect i had for you Mr. Naidu, you are nothing but an opportunist, pulling back of alliance just before the 2019 elections, power lusty politicians are not doing any good for the country."
What I am saying............
He brought AP no.1 in corruption.
CBN mortgaged AP Special to Son and his crupption practice. Jai JanaSena
"Why is nobody asking, why Babu was silent all these years and woke up only now? Just only less than a year before the elections?"
"Mr. Idiot... Arnab Goswami will not highlight the failures of this BJP govt.... But will try to divert the topic by criticizing the Congress....shame on this paid media Supari journalist....
And what more you can expect from a channel owned and funded by a BJP Rajya sabha MP.....
It is high time that we should ignore these type of rascal journalists who brought the fraternity of journalism to the lowest level.....
However I wish that Mr Naidu and Andhra Pradesh should be given their due.... Or else go for a seperate Dravida naadu....or else protest to set a seperate finance commission for the south India..."
Arnab don't raise u r voice in front of Mr naidu
this bloody chanal support BJP.
"Some people criticizing cbn's English.that's their opinion.but they have to know that he didn't studied in USAor UK.so,despite criticism he never hesitated to speak.with that language ,he brought Microsoft to Hyderabad,being selected to WEF among worlds greatest people."
"What i am saying, What i am saying. finally i am not able to understanding what you saying. Please give a straight answer to the media.

What Narendra modi told you when you have 10 min conversation ?
Do you trust congress party on giving special category status ?
What you done this four years without asking special status ?
if you are a sencere politician , what happened waving framer load. giving money to the unemployed person.
Taking thousands of acre on the name of capital building."
India's best cm @CHANDRABABUNAIDU
"presenting grievances of AP people in a more effective way is a need of the hour..  If you get a chance to speak to national media ,,,,, utilize the opportunity,,,,, tell point wise what are things mentioned in the GOVERNMENT ACT and how modi govt. is not implementing.... Naidu sir ,,,, kindly once again go to national media and tell the things in more effective way... you are known to entire country.... if you will speak definitely it will influence the entire country."
How this cheater cm bought 23 MLAs from opposition.how he decided amaravaathi capital as his caste is more there
"Arnab.. can you shut the fuck going behind Rahul Gandu ..  CM clearly mentioning about PM and his meeting and their discussion .. you don’t want to put PM in back foot so you foolishly, moved the conversation towards congress and Rahul.... why you are so picky on topic .. come on man.."
Arnab ka sakal Dekh kai he Marne ka Maan karta hai
remember once upon a time naidu is the minister of the Congress government.
CBN is a PM material. Modi Bodi is just a Gujju CM material
"Journalist: 2:45 ""You are one of the smartest politician in the country""
how did you not understand their intend before and waited till the end of last budget...?
answer by cm: again same old story...
lol
got vexed by AP CM answers.

every issues comes in to place, just before elections
worst move by senior most politician

J"
Chappal maro arnab chutiya ko
"I feel Mr. cm CB. naidu would have presented the promises and govt. Act, made by parliament in a systematic manner and if  he would have told that how GOVT. ACT was not implemented , that might have worked more,,, as it is a national media and thousands of people will watch apart from AP PEOPLE.... if presented in a more effective manner, It would have given good result I think NAIDU SIR must once again must go to national media and tell point to point the promises made in GOVERNMENT ACT and how it is not implemented."
"Thank you all for extending your support to our CM & concern over special category status to AP. Really , we the people of Andhra suffered a lot by the acts & false promises of both UPA & NDA governments."
CBN should be next PM
Arnab is a liar... AL time exposed
Anti Congress channel
Sir we respect you but why did you not fight about special status for 4 years and why did you take u turn now .
"He is the chief minister hu gave 50 laks to Other party MLC as a bribe u can see in you tube ,he is the CM hu said dat he will give 2000 to evry person hu he is not having job ,bt he didn’t..,he is the person hu killed indirectly many people in pushakaras u can see in u tube ..,he is the person hu gave 50 pages false promises...,I don’t belong to any party ..,I am frustrated person ..,he is the person hu agreed to special package ,bt wen dha ppl dis agreee he kpt ppl in jail.,not as dis became sentiment he is playing gamessss please help us .., please give jobs to us .,plz help my family"
BJP running country down
arnab not a jernal. he is clear agent of niraj modi and bjp. Rahul gandhi is the most credible man in India.
Arnab is big chamcha of Modi
"AP deserves special status 
All states deserves special status
Let all states enjoy special status.
Naidu deserves PM post
Siddharamaya deserves PM post
Pappu deserves PM post
Mamata deserves PM post
Pinarayi deserves PM post
Lallu deserves PM post
Mayavati deserves PM post
Let all states have special status of independent republic nation, and have these smart sorry honest politicians as their PM. 

That's it.  All go home."
Respect the c.m of A.p...my friend
great administrator even with deficit funds... we are with you always sir.....  bjp playing bloody politics...  even congress...
"Seems most comments on republic are from fake ID, paid by pappu, sponsored by bar dancer sonia."
These brainless cheap and sluggish Arnab is playing the same tricks with Mr Babu for which he was thrown and kicked out of Times.....Mad shit.....
blsht naydu bulsht
Jai CBN... We are with you in your fight.... Against Central and Modi... Jai Jai CBN
self dabba
Arnab why u are always hurry to ask questions. I hate your attitude better shutdown the R tv and sleep.
Andhra Pradesh is not eligible for Special Status...there are many states are eligible for that except Ap
many cases against him...also he got stays in all cases..he is cunning...better example of Mr. Naidu is he is a Black Mamba.....
Hats off CBn ... he should be the PM of India
BJP not only ditched AP but whole nation by implementing GST and Demonetisation..now it is our turn to dump BJP...
Great cm
"C for Corruption 
B for betrayal 
N for NO sincerity 
THAT is CBN"
"Dude he is chief minister,  have some respect dude .He is the only person who laid path  when no external party supported Vajpayee ji .Every one knows Vajpayee ji gave respect to him. Please dude call advani and talk about his problems.. Murali manohar joshi your senior leader met him even though babu was fighting with BJP"
Cbn sir you should ask we neeed special status . The way u explained tells that you are saying it is people sentiment and asking pm . Don’t you think that is wrong . Please stop dramas and cheap tricks
Awesome!! I knew you guys will come down to your original self of using abusing languages and below the belt comments.. I don't blame you for that. Actually the filthy people from UP and Bihar as referred by one' of you are far better. They at least don't pretend to be sofisticated as you guys do. I  know you guys are used to appeasement politics of freebies. But you won't get that from Modi.. nothing comes free from him.. that's why people hate him..so keep going Modi holds 75% of Indian hates and few haters like you won't make much difference..jai hind
You should learn uploading the full video.
"Please refer bifercation act arnab in that they have mentioned special category state and railway zone and port like that so many things are there.for example If we are  talk about special category state BJP was told remaining states are opposing next again they come up with new idea 14 finance commission.Leave it this special category.what about railway zone.agin BJP is telling other state s are opposing like that so many things are there.this is only one example.Iphone manufacturing company they plan to setup plant in Tirupati.PM used his influence to setup that company in Gujarat state.leave it all this thing why you were separated the state of you were not able to give anything.How the government will run with debicate funds for long time.In order to run government smoothly you have to provide money or otherwise some industrial benefits then only companies  will plan to start their industry in Ap .last and final question  BJP is released some sort of money in order to set up metro in Ahmadabad. For example take two states A and B .A is full developed state B is the state of andrapradesh.  For A state government released 100lakh cr and for b state 20 lakh cr in. budget.Do you think is it correct ?if you give like this how many years we have to depend on you.i think BJP is thinking that there is no more  Congress at all any how these Ap Peoples have stay with us only.PM  announced so many things to Ap.He was not in able to do that things.ok atleast he is not able to  communicate with peoples of Andra .leave it this also in parliament he has to give some explanation why we are not giving and what is the plan to support Ap .I don't want any thing verbally ,please release for valid documents.What he did for the nation .Why you are not pulling him into interview.Apart from any public meetings he gave any personal interview what is going to do for the nation."
I support CBN
Except kamma people no one developed in andhr pradesh. Kulagajji party.
"He's an asshole. ! I'm from AP ! i voted him as a supporting cause for NDA ! I BET 1 lakh if he gets power again






."
"What I am saying, I am senior politician."
I am from Tamilnadu and i support  Mr.Chandrababu Naidu one of the best Chief minister in the country he improved andhra pradesh a lot and he completed what he said in his election manifesto
"Arnab knows no good manners. First thing Arnab, learn to listen first and don't interrupt and let your guests complete what they are saying."
"The Andhra Pradesh BJP Leaders (ex congress leaders) are main culprits to destroy BJP in Andhra Pradesh. I am totally disappointed with BJP, because they trusted the crooks of ex congress BJP Leaders. I always admired BJP and TDP. But now I can't vote to BJP in 2019."
Arnab there is not even a single time you supported CM cause of developing his state in this debate. You have become pathetic. I don't belong to Andhra and I'm not anti BJP.
"Mr. Naidu ji u r the 40 years experienced politician. U visited modi & jaitly - 29 times Delhi from 4 years, is it any use full for 29 visits. In 2016 u support for special package (60-40)- now u ask for status. It's so silly.
What about our students arrest & PD act during dharna for status in 2016.
How many times u change ur voice. First u stand for one word. Then automatically status will come. Telugu people not a fools."
This Republic TV they always try to    convey message to the public that they are always correct and the opposite person to whom ever they are having the conversation with are wrong especially this arnab doesn't even know how to talk with senior party leaders ...........No offence...
"Arnab want to know just what would be the political stunt CBN
Modi paid media just want to blame Congress 
What the hell cheater Modi did to the state as well as country 
Everything done for Power hunger 
We want Modi mukth barath
Still we have good opinion on BJP 
BUT unfortunately it becomes puppet in the Hands of TWO cheaters
NAMO - Namimchu Mosamcheyyi
JAI CBN
JAI AP 
I’m from Telangana ✊️"
we clearly know that republic TV is trying to destory the creation of a common front against BJP. We dont know what is a background of this indirect media support to BJP.
Arnab.. we all knew who is channel stakeholders and knew whom u r going to bark... Useless fellow get out of journalism..
"backbone less centre, lets follow a cooperative fedralism. Respect all states. India is not only UP and north india."
"Congress is far better than BJP
BJP will never win a seat in 2019 Elections.

Jai Janasena Jai Hindh"
Veedi abaddalu Delhi lo kuda chebtunnadu. Hyd veede develop chesadanta
"This is CBN's drama to cover up his and his cronies corruption, he is feeling the heat. What happened to all the funds and debt? He could not complete one flyover in Vijayawada from last 4 years and he is dreaming of building Singapore, he is only good at fooling gullible people."
"CBN is fighting for a genuine cause, we support you sir. Chennai was lost to TN when Andhra was carved out of Madras presidency within few years we built our own metro city Hyderabad. Now its gone to our brothers in Telangana just wait for few more years we will show you another metro Amaravathi."
"Aranab you are questioning to CM that Special Status can't be given and as a senior Politician don't you know that, the same question we are asking Modi does not know that it can't be implemented when he promised"
No democracy in Andhra Pradesh
Worst cm in India
Mister arnab..Plz complete cm speech...
"I came to Delhi 29 times, for what?"
He might not get support of Congress for NO confidence motion if he answer Congress is not the solution for Andhra . Arnab ur smart and he is sincere
arnab waste anchor. .
Good question sir naidu no answer naidu son corruption son
Jai telugudesam jai chandrababu
Chandrababu accepted special package and praised Modi for 4 years and now doing all dramas just for elections. Chandrababu is the most corrupt CMs in India. Chandrababu praises himself and is well known for backstabbing and cheating.
Superb Questions from Arnab
Goswami u just ask vote ki note case
"Special status is not sentiment
It is a right"
Breeder me
"Mr Arnab, where do you go if your one partner avoids you out of two.  there is no need to trust Congress but asking favour of non bjp parties who have MPs. there is no wrong to go with Congress and other parties for special status of AP. why are you insisting on to believe in Rahul or not"
"From four years our CM said BJP is helping a lot. CM said no need of Special Status, there is a special   package for us. Now taking U turn and saying BJP is not helping and demanding special status. And how can central government announce special status to AP if AP's GDP is more than National Average GDP."
Arnab has become BJP man. Always talking on the behalf of bjp
Whay I'm asking...what u r saying?
A bad politician
"Cbn didnot allot atleast 500 crs to capital Amaravathi from his last 4 year state budjets. But Modi had gave advance 2, 500 crs to capital Amaravathi. Cbn had taken 4 years just to select the DESIGNS OF ASSEMBLY&SECTERIAT. But modi Modi should complete 2 lakh crore projects within 5years. Modi given 20,000 crs roads from capital Amaravathi to Rayalseema and uttaraandhra total state interlinked. Modi had given outer ring road 180 km to Amaravathi capital cost 10,000 crs.. Modi had interlinked Railwaylines from amaravathi to vijayawada and guntur cost 2000 crs. Modi had given 11 national educational institutions in that 9 ready running. Modi had given industrial corridor. Modi had given 2 lakh houses. centre is constructing polavram project cost 50,000 crs. Modi had given 24 hours power supply to state. Modi had given tax incentives to Rayalseema districts. BUT CBN HAS NO SINGLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WITHI HIS 2 LAKH CRORE BUDGET."
Best CM in India
Why did you go 29 times?
This same man accepted Special pacakge and mocked at YSJagan when he is fighting for Special status From 2014 but now just before the election year started his drama.. Worst CM ever..
"He is only senior politician in India 

What the hell?

Tell what u really accepted with BJP and be transparent with AP people"
And the CM cleverly and clearly using all his experience banged Arnab saying congress and BJP are the same in doing injustice to people... That's true
Arnab intentionally interrupting the CM and shifting him from saying anything on BJP to congress and Rahul.. From this it is clear that he is an paid artist...
Faye dsouza of mirror now is better than this arnab... She knows how to conduct debates... Just check the way she conducts herself on the debate of fuel prices... Amazing... Gives everyone to speak and unbiased... Not like arnab... He sold himself to the bjp
"Here is another BJP scam, Arnab what is your research saying about this: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nrsU7vjBqU"
"Dynamic leader,, 
I m from Assam"
Great Naidu
7:30 Chandrababu naidu don't know the meaning of SMART.
Most corrupted CM of AP
No matter how many times you ask. CBN will never give a straight answer. Like you said he is the smartest politician in INDIA
Chetta laga...interviews lo kuda dabba kottu kuntunadu CBN
Dear Naidu please improve your english.
See you national media see what happened in bifurcation time you are all supported one side that's wrong so please go right way
Vadi question. vidi answers ki samandham ledhu
Vidu am matladutunnado vidikey telidhu
In the past India was defeated by Islamic Mughals and then Christian British due to people like these CBN who are hell bent on breaking India into pieces. Shame on him!
"Andhra Pradesh deserves special status,we aren't anti-BJP but we feel betrayed"
I saw only one politician who always says iam sincear and uncurropted politician in the county in any interview...all the politicians are corrupt including him
I support Ap cm because he is the best cm in India
"Republic TV is betraying the nation and supporting Modi, the liar. Why? What is it's interest?"
good job arnab..we all know BJP denied SCS TO AP 2YRS BACK...CBN said YES to package ..now doing election politics
Chutia arnab ghuma fira ke Congress mai topic leke aata. Arnab ko moti rakam mili hai bjp she lagta hai.
"Selfish thinking is the cause of destruction don't be fanatic about your own states and blame modi
When govt is ready to give equivalent to special status why don't u a c cent forget your own status pride and language this is big de ease in India language fanatics country only for name sake
It's all your fault forget your state fanatics you don't bother other state to develop only yours"
Endi ra eere what I am saying. Cheppandi ra babu evaedanna vadiki
This CBN is Man Version Of Sonia Gandhi. whole country needs to know his true face. I have never seen a More cunning person than this CBN.
What I am saying oscar award goes to CBN for cunning character
"Since BJP is not doing well in the south it just doesnt do anything for those states where it doesnt have any chance to come in like Andhra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala"
Arnab is such an irritating anchor. He doesn't allow anyone to talk
"BJP is cheating AP is the most disgusting way. A party which cannot face no-confidence motion and which cannot make allies calm down in Parliament cannot rule the nation. All the myths are brushed. Modi is just a politician and not a god man as forecasted before 2014 elections. 

BJP will pay for hurting the Telugus. All we are asking is to fulfill promises and BJP is using this situation for political gains. We had enough !!!! 

For Gods sake, why is granting a railway zone has to be delayed ???"
Wow he is claiming sitting apposition leader as a credit .  What a pity..
"Arnab  stupid ,first listen what naidu saying"
"CBN is a great soul. 
One question is not answred...Does he find opposition to be better than the Chaiwalla?●"
To be honest Narendra Modi and Chandra Babu Naidu are the most charismatic and future oriented leaders right now. Our country needs both of them equally.
Wtf every one talking about CBN. vision .. what did he do past 4 yrs . Nothing .. he has whole lot of media support (yellow media) that’s how he is surviving
After understanding only CBN arrived at Delhi.JAI CBN JAI TDP JAI ANDHRA
"As a Modi fan, it is a miserable and total failure by Modi government on fulfilling promises and execute them, remember Modi sir you have lost a most trusted, honorable, committed and value-added ally called Telugu Desam and a great leader Chandrababu Naidu's trust."
Great Leader CBN!!!.
"CBN sounds like a broken record. Repeating the same things over and over. In this issue, CBN has been hoodwinked by Modi. Shame on a leader who claims he is smart and has a vision etc. Modi is very likely a 12th std. pass. How could CBN get fooled by this semiliterate thug? Shame shame! CBN should take support of the Congress. Jaggu will be licking Modi’s piles anyway."
1. 70 lakh crores of faud in 4 years in AP. God must help Andhra not Modi
Third front is alternative and good for south India.
Idiot Modi will not win in Karnataka.  Wait and see.
SHAME ON ARNAB.........YOU ARE TAKING SIDES.
"what I am saying  do any other parties other than CBN Before media in support of AP.....  CBN ,,, , 40 years.........exp...  hahaha..  helping to dump people of  AP..Even chairman denied but he was agreed for special package in 2016"
Modi will visit to AP in the next few months and then promise more projects 2.1111lakh crores.  But he can't cheat AP people 2nd time
"CBN is great and he is a proved politician. just read articles on hyderabad and how he built hyderabad which is bread and jam for crores of people, including North Indians who work in hyderabad.. I dint see any CM and PM in India who went  for investments and gave presentations at early 90s. In fact most of them didn’t see a computer in 90s. If you go anywhere in the world, you find most of them are Telugu ppl in IT jobs . That’s just because of his initiatives 90s..even today he brought KIA , hero Honda, Foxconn, Ashok Leland and Franklin Templeton to Andhra Pradesh. It is just happened because of his vision. Is there anyone dare to show other CM brought any such companies last 4 years?. I don’t think anyone. Most of them are just do politics, play around Delhi. Everyone does politics in and it is mandatory in democratic countries. At the same time they have to take initiatives on how to increase the economy... anyways good luck cbn"
"i never realized that chandrababu naidu is also another damn f..n politician. he is another dirty politician
\"
Why Arunb divert Betraying act from BJP to Congress? Here BJP is the villan for Federal spirit
Now he is jocker in AP... Mr. Arnab u have ask him money for vote case..
"How about all states decide to separate making some 90 states and ALL having Special, Super special and Extra Super Special statuses. WOWWWWWW. India will be Special Superpower in no time.
If you can't keep unity.. you stand on your own.  Don't beg for Special needs charity by blackmailing the  Center 
 Tough luck."
I am very very sensior politician..He developed Hyderabad but all lands of local Hyderabadis took and given to his caste people.  Because of him today Andhra struggling. Un faith politician in Andhra that's why he was in 10 years opposition.  That why Central government is not trusting him. Caste base politician.
"He wants his capital better than Delhi then do on your guts why is begging to center, 
Other state may have ask same thing"
What i am saying. What i am saying.
Fuck arnab you should push bjp to do something to Andhra Pradesh.. don’t push chandrababu to tell about congress or bjp..
Im proud of my CM chandrababu.
"No need to give special status to Andhra, it's only for north east states.."
Modi is a bugger..betrayed AP
King of India @CBN@
He will never reply to your question Arnab he say what he want to say only..
"why is the video incomplete, is that how a channel uploads on youtube..."
"chandrababu naidu is a black mailer thats it.  why they need special status, there are many states which are in bad condition. why govt has to give to andra. All money given to naidu was looted by his men and now asking more money"
What I am saying.....Mr.babu cheated Andhra people ....now Andhra is first place in more corrupted states because of his team ...!!!! Sure he is going to be loose in next elections.....
No what I am saying is. :D
It is very clear.
Search vote for note in google Babu is a big 420
Mr. Collection King CBN why ur not ask last 4 years  Spl status to BJP?
Corruption is so high in politics that CM always walk with a beggar bowl to Modi.
Requesting Republican tv to use your good offices to implement reorganization act in true spirit. If not no party will believe bjp and modi in the next elections
Chandrababu Naidu is nice person. But hold done on special status.
ARNAB is always behave like any idiot
CBN is visionary and great leader. Really AP people are gifted with CBN.Hope more development is on the way in his leadership. No doubt a true inspiring leader.
Arnub did u ask same questions to yogi when he appeared on your republic tv....Rahul Gandhi acted by himself to attend the protest...will Andhra Pradesh cheif minister know in advance and stop him from entering...
Mr. Naidu will be the next pm
AP people ...Please don't lose CBN
Helping hand IS extended to AP - clearly stated in Lok Sabha by Jaitley in the form of crores of rupees for development - without the stamp of special status.  Stop fooling people.  This is purely political!  He has ambition on a national scale.
We stand with Modi.
As soon as Naidu berates BJP this BJP stooge jumps in . Arnab shame on you! You are a blot on journalism. We are not idiots. If u kepp doing this bjp will suffer the same defeat congress suffered. Mend your ways before its too late
You r been from kamma community  and it is going to  die surely.....
Arnab - bootlicker of BJP
Fuck off modi...
"Telugodi paruvu testunavga 
Adu adigedenti nuv chepedenti
Karma ra babuuuu"
Why don’t these national channels news anchors don’t give respect to our South Indian leaders.  Do they forget their manners and descency?
"HEY ARNAB, FIRST GIVE RESPECT TO OUR CM MR. CHANDRA BABU NAIDU.  First listen to him after asking ur question.  It irritates us when u talk with ur loud voice, while someone answers ur questions"
"I think there is no enough money in central to help CBN and also 100-200 crores help will not working, nearly need 30,000 crores to make smart state."
"Wow, arnab covering south india? How the heck did that happen? Oh i know, it's becos it affects his beloved BJP. Arnab gives no shits about south india or even indians in general. Just shouting theatre to divide us all every night."
I will support Modi and I do not trust TDP or YSRCP. I am an Indian first and a Telugu next.
AP needs and demand special status we are totally fed up with the hell words of centre every one was even not hearing the word of Telugu people
"Arnab Ji this is what the smart answers said by the CM of AP even now he is not clearing any thing regarding whome he is supporting. Most experienced politician in India can’t even make the country to see the situation of AP by resigning all the M.Ps in parliament, this is because of their selfish rulings. One question directly to CBN why you made lathicharged on the people who supported for special status in 2016 . Answer this"
Mr Arnab you asked him one straight question that as a seasonal politician why u have not predicted the BJP mind that Bjp will not give special status at first instance and he didn't understood your question only and there by answering some thing to ur question . his 40 years industry is past and still he is projecting the same. We want that 40 years industry to get the special status. He also said there is no Congress in ap and not even got the deposits and the same scene will repeat for his party also if he didn't get status. His 40 years industry will not work everytime. we as an unemployed youth were suffering like anything and 10 year generations are impacted due to political bifurcation. We don't have jobs in our state and every one has to leave our state and go out of our state to get the jobs. These stupid politicians are playing with our careers and future of Andhra Pradesh. Arnab expose this problem on a national wide to get the justice to our AP
He slams Arnab very badly
yes he is very good cm for particular caste and their benefits
Make this guy the PM he will put India on world map...Or CM of UP
"CBN is one of the most hardworking and great leaders. He did not stay quietly without doing any development in Ap waiting for the money or co-operation that should come from central govt. He acted as an intelligent person for four years as he gave chance to the central govt to act and prove themselves. CBN has brought many companies and industries without the help of the central govt. We need People like CBN in politics if we want India to develop. 
I appeal to whole India that politics are different and development is different. Every state should develop like Ap. So center needs to give a helping hand when persons like CBN is working very hard. I am s/w engineer and I am proud to say that this is because of our Cheif minister CBN. Don't bring only politics into the picture leaving the development. I am ashamed to say that Modi is not developing the country but only doing politics in every state.
Arnab please keep politics aside for some time when one state is requesting for its rights."
"I wish one day, no matter how much sometimes I do admire Arnab, I slap him so hard that he will learn to never interrupt someone whilst they are speaking! Thrashhole."
CBN is most corrupted politician in Indian history
Best cm ever in india
"Where are these fucking reddies, first time in my life I'm starting to hate reddies"
Dear arnab...  Let him go with congress...  Don't fear that bjp will lose
"What have you lost.....??? U have  Idiots,beggars (mla's) in ur party corrupting & looting the economical resources of ur state....&.y da fuck' u alwazzz keep on saying that u have developed Hyderabad.....???  Is that really u ???Hyderabad is the richest state before independence....do u know that....??? U don't have any answers for ur corruption in the state and alwazz show fuckin' bifurcation as a reason....!!!cheap tricks....U r a wolf....!!!"
"Arnav is not happy with the answers from Naidu babu..
Arnav only wants answers which is biased towards modiji.. #godimedia"
Great leader jagan  Jai jagan
CBN WILL GET 13 M.P 's in 2019..jagan will get 12...what can he do to Modi...stop drama in Delhi..
"he will support NDA again after 2019 elections 
it is only pressure politics"
"CBN is a true Leader. He takes responsibility in any given situation, however difficult situation it is. True Leadership qualities."
"Arnub, please don't do journalism for the sake of some TRP ratting. Can't u hear what Mr. CNB saying, if both parties( central govt.,) illiterate and deny justice. Where should we go seek. Why don't you highlight this to people of India. Here a state govt asking for help for the mistakes committed by central ruled parties divided the state with out consent of people and no capital city and infrastructure to establish and sustain growth.
So highlight the issue and doing politics is not your work, try to make sense out of journalism."
I think naidu shouldn't speak to arnab goswami because arnab is agent of BJP.
"Compare IT exports of Chennai,Bangalore,pune and Gurgaon..Hyderabad is the least...what city did he develop..sic"
Next Prime Minister of India Who had All Rights with Vision and Mission ..
I'm from Uttar Pradesh and I want a CM like him in my state. I hope he becomes Prime Minister of Indian someday! ❤️❤️ Love you Sir!
Very useful conversation between both of them. One should not trust #CBN just like that. He is completely diverting the debate by speaking nonsense things.
Modi is a cheater. May someone help Andhra people.
Jai cbn
#babuisabitch
"At least learn some basic English and then speak Mr Naidu .we know you are useless
We are not expecting anything from a publicity freak like you"
Hez working hard to develop AP..but these BJP  is playing blame game with AP... Janasena and YSRCP is backing BJP
Y don’t said straight answer for questions
Our cr is a ugly son of a bitch...  I wish he dies...
What am saying... U turn Uncle
"Smartest cm?? My ass...  He is always boasting his image through media,  not even a fair guy.. He played to his whims and fancies ignoring the state.."
Arnob goswami pehle bat Karna sikhle....
"In this 10 minutes discussion, Naidu not even uttered a world ""SPecial Status""...that shows how much clarity he has on what he needs. All he says is ""What i am Saying is"", ""I am a sincere politician""..."
he is a snake
"CBN Sir you are the senior most politician, 40 years experience, and you developed Hyderabad, agreed ....but plz don't keep no repeating it"
Are you modi ka kutta ??
chandra babu is 420...hence all people  in AP suffering
he should think beyond his state and think bout country
"you are a Senior politician,So what and I have a question for you as a CM could you please tell to all the AP people what you did in these last 4 years"
What iam saying is....
ggg
What is he talking? He accepted spl package that central govt offered and today he has no option but to fight for spl category status as people don't want spl package but spl category status. Apparent that he is feared of election....
"In 4yrs , what you as done to AP , now your asking about special status ,  because your going to elections in next year , you developed your company's  in 4yrs ......"
"This cbn with his trusted news papers and print media andhrajyothi radhakrishna enadu and almost 6 news channels 
in andhra Pradesh is doing everything to  dent the image of narendra modi our pm and also bjp every day since 4years ...and acting as an ally..as a telugu guy I have clear you dat...ask any of your Telugu friends...these news papers projecting pm as murderer,psycho,and anarchist and  every possible lie on bjp and modi...if any wrong happened in ap this media throws it on modi and blaming him..if good happens giving credit to cbn..when bjp came to know all this nonsense he took u turn and crying as victim..."
its purely politics ... for 4 years this fellow  kept silent now he is pulling out of NDA.. its purely politics... hope people of AP not get foolef
Republic is BJP TV
why is only 10min uploaded .. i request republic tv to upload full interview
why should give special status only to Andhra pradesh... wat abt other states like maharshtra karnataka tamil nadu kerala etc... other state peoples are not human beings??
Nono what I am saying is CBN is the worst CM and he himself said we don't need special status!!! Now he took u turn and asking for special status.
He is avoiding questions
"I saw some people ridiculing his English here in comments. To all those morons.. His ideology matters, not English. He's the only politician who stood against Congress for all his life. Salute Sir!"
"Mr. Arnab is so much biased... man....he is always targeting a particular party;
he can't stand anyone criticizing his so called favoured party;

No wonder ""Freedom of media"" is at stake. Want proof? Here are some:

1)India ranks a low 136/180 in PRESS FREEDOM RANKINGS 2017.

2)Recent spy cam operations of COBRA POST revealed how Indian media could  be easily bought to give fake news.So, NO longer is media a PILLAR of democracy.Its a pillar that has crashed and the superstructure has fallen apart.

I wonder what these guys will do when someone else comes to power in 2019.Will they shift side? or will they not? 

Journalism should be NEUTRAL; u need to question both sides; can't just keep attacking a party only because you personally prefer that party; or maybe they fund you...just saying...standard of journalism needs huge improvement for people in general to have trust back."
His beard is looks awesome
Fox cbn
"if naidu asks money for his state
.. then every state has right to ask money...."
Rip bjp in ap
why did chandrababu naidu silent for 4 years.. this is purely politics... people of Andhra should think... y he is speaking now...
modi is supportive to every one... AP is not a special state.. everyone is equal... states in India are equal and same why to give special status to AP..  wat abt other states.. if every state asks  for special status... wat abt the future of this country
"Is this the way arnab speaks to a state cheif minister ..Mr Naidu and calls him self most creadibility reader, this is biggest s##t on you
@arnab goswami"
14 th commission never said there is no special status officially. BJP said that. The special status was accepted by TDP. The BJP doesn't want to make it as legal
Babu eng is better than Modi
Arey idiot chandrababu. How many times you this bloody words that I developed city of Hyderabad. Don't act smart. Explain about vote ki note case. Explain about your internal kamma feeling. Are you a cm or a broker
"Cbn ki respect ekkada
Arnab first learn how to give respect to senior leaders"
"He is not a leaders the word is not suitable for him.
he making many things for his community and Beenamies.

what he was doing for Hyderabad same thing repeated in amaravathi.

what I mean to say  am a middle class men am not able buy or make a home on Hyderabad. I meant please develop Al over the state not only guntur and Vijayawada.Andhrapradesh had lack of resource less please develop  other district in East,west,rayalaseema area."
CBN committed 1200 promises at the time of election compain but how many he fulfilled. Not even 60
"What iam saying .
Iam a most senior political leader in India .
S.
So we r given a chance to build ap.
But u gave a chance to Narayana , Ganta , rayapati , and great leader Lokesh , sujana, , Ramesh etc.. for plunder.

Finally ap voters are big fools ."

Wt I'm asking and wt I'm saying
"Double standard man, he should have been fought for special status but he was convinced with special package but now he takes u turn and demanding special status any how political equations apart each and every political party in AP should be United to fight against bjp for special status"
Even cm is afried to speak with  arnab ji...Cm ji is little nervous hahahaha
Most honest-sincere- hard working-Brilliant CM

Sir we loves u sir.. Ji cbn
worst leader in india.......
"No doubt he is the legend and senior most politician 


He is leader


He can play an important role."
BJP betrayed AP People very badly
"For those who are commenting on his English,he is the only politician from India who is a very good friend of Bill gates,he played vital role in national politics right from deciding prime ministers to stating demonetisation has to be done even before Modi has implemented it,first ever politician in India to give a power point presentation way back in 19’s  to foreign delegates,running the state efficiently and brought it to one of the top 5 states in the country and atlast the only hope for ANDHRA PRADESH. Jaiiii Chandra Babu Naidu !!!!!!!"
"Smart politician,   you will never get answers from naidu arnab"
this is very waste debate
Arnab is trying to convince as if he is Modi. Lol. He is too much.
Mai CBN Ko support karta hu. Ap should be helped. Partly by center and partly by the telengana government.
We support CBN. CBN is the great leader. Best CM too.
CBN is one of the great leader in India ....
Mr.Arnab let him speak yar.

We support CBN
Arnab ji always support BJP don't know y he always blames congress
Arnab sir pls help ap .ur no1 journalist in India pls help ap
"The people who are commenting against south India and the Dravidian language vulgarly let me remind you that, we are the people who are native to this land called bharat
The Aryans came to this land after indus valley civilization and there DNA are similar with the Europeans DNA 
The DNA of Dravidians doesn't match to any other people in rest of world, so it's clear that we are native to this land more then u do
The north Indian so called pseudo Hindus who aren't native to this land, then how come u say that Muslims are not native to this land ???? 
Today if our people don't want to speak Hindi then they tag us as #anti Hindi people , where as these people don't speak any of our language or learn them then what should we tag u??, there are also people who say if u don't know Hindi then you are not an Indian 
We have given this land many scientists who made India proud, most of the scientists in ISRO,DRDO are south Indians 
We made India's identity by its IT services 
What did u people gave India ??? Who is more patriot?? We or u ??
When today we demand government more funds to make our cities or states batter then they us that we are anti hindi, less patriot and lungi walas??? Where does the a  apartheid lie ???
Is it not fare to demand more money for welfare of our People?? The center gave 25700 crores to make Dwarka convention in UP, but it gave 15000 crores to construct a capital to AP"
"Cbn garu as a senior most politician and a visionary leader,u need to do some homework on trimming and grooming your english skills.I am also a telugu guy but people observe ur english first than the content of ur talk. If that is improved your are no doubt a great leader for India."
What i am saying thappa emi radu
Arnab u are clean bowled..
"Modiji please keep up your words , or else people of Andhra and Telangana will teach center a lesson soon ,history speaks for itself"
Jai Arnab
Sir this tactics in past present and future  just before elections
CBN developed Hyderabad and donated it to the beggars of Telangana. He should be supported now. The Telangana rioters were politically motivated and they used the bloody Congress to take away the hardwork of AP
Babu is a good cm
Debate with facts not with propoganda. thank you.
So Congress is solution to Andhra Pradesh
And can u please say how much investments did CBN bring to amaravathi
Arnub I respect u but don't laugh ugly. He is my CM we from AP . just remember 2 names NTR&YSR Delhi will shake if anybody touch AP
arnab had bend his ass to cbn respect republic tv........one more subsciber
arnab goswami is graduaally losing his respect.....in interview with bjp leaders he speaks with calm and softly but look at his agressive approach towards non bjp people!!!!!!!Sold media......try to be a neutral journalist.....
"In india we spend 
3600cr for shivaji status 
3000cr for patel status 
300cr for ram mandir 
But 1500cr for AMARAVATI for new capital city of Andhra Pradesh 
Yes india will be 3rd biggest economy country in the world"
"he is the person who said that in front of media "" special status is not a sanjivani & we will arrest if any one fight for the special status "", now in AP everyone came to know that he is just manipulating since last 4 years, that's why he is doing all the drama with support of yellow media.. don't  trust him guys, he back stabbed his own party Founder Sr. NTR to became CM, he can do anything for power"
What iam saying
He is begging all up to now no development
"What iam saying ,....what I'm asking... What this....."
Smart Anchor but CBN is smarter then the smartest..
Nice interview by arnab
"Fuck you Moooodi....
Fuccccccccccckkkkkkkk you orrrrrnob"
No Perfect Answers... From Our CM
Mr Arnab remember your speaking with a leader on behalf off 5cr telugu people
King of indian politics is chandrababu naidu
Even I respect Modi however we have respect the constitution and then words given in the parliament by the Prime Minister of India.  Isn't that unconstitutional by not doing anything to the words said by current govt which anti congress. Anrt the people of Andhra belong to this country.  You tell us for 4 years no mention abt the state. You tell a solution when Modi himself said in the parliament that AP is suffering from what congress has done and now congress wants to rectify their mistake if Modi is not doing
down down bjp  JAI babu
"IAM so sorry sir,our neighbor states telengana got a separate state they fight they struggled & they won.in case of Tamil Nadu they fight against the ardinance regarding Jilli kattu & they won. But what AP achieved we unable to get special status & kadapa steel plant & Vizag railway zone. I am from AP. & Today IAM very much ashamed that we will be quoted as lossers in history. As we are unable to get anything which is our rights that they are promised. Come let's revolt we will stand by ur side let's fight for the glory of Telugu ppl"
"I don't like national channels. Bcz they don't know how to give respect to the Higher position people.  Using single meaning ""you""."
"Even though AP re organisation Act gets implemented, nothing will happen to Andhra. After implementing, they will say some other reasons to survive. Don't trust this non-sense society. Try to come out of reality people."
"Arnab want to blame Congress , and support modi and babu want blame bjp and support his credibility , what have been doing since 4 years ,if you such a senior and smartest politician"
all AP people wants to justice. please help us. CHNDRA BABU is best CM.
Great CM sir..the companies eastblished their operations in AP only because of trust on your leadership and your vision...keep fighting for our demands .. we are with you..we will with you...
1. What i am saying... No no.. what i am saying... 2. You have to understand here.. 3. I am most senior politician...
What Iam saying
"You are right Arnab..He is a smart and seasoned politician. When CBN does something bad to someone , it is called  Sincerity and utmost respect should be given to him.  But viceversa, he doesn't accept. See the smartness"
Arnab must be polite & patient enough until others complete.
Mr Naidu leads !!
Hyderabad ni develop chese  tappudu Hyderabad ki special status unde na??? Ledu ga.... appudu Hyderabad ni world map lo peeti nappudu ippu Amaravati ni develop cheyada ki special status enduku???
its very clear that arnab is bjp propagandist and another boot licker of modi
U know wt I am saying!!!!!
CBN not answered properly to questions. He is escaping from questions.  Becoz he is a cheater of AP
uffff where is the conclusion answer why did you cut it... it is very importent to the country
"""What I am saying "" is Mr.Naidu has done nothing to AP, But the thing is corruption gone high. Central Government knows about that and stopped giving the funds and new programs. Now Mr. Naidu blaming BJP and YSRCP for his survival in 2019 elections. 

What I'm saying what I'm saying. U can say anything but u did nothing"
"Mr.  Arnab please give due respect to the person who is in front of you , dont get over exaggerated and with your body language,  your questions are closed questions with intent to fix other person."
The top most corrupted CM in India Mr.ChandraBabu Naidu
why you told special status is not sanjivini
He is the no 1 cm in india
Naydu  g dabla  geym  Bay

We are so proud to be a visionary leader like cbn
"He is out dated politician. This is political stunt. After 4 years he speaks nonsense. In these 4 years he has been changing his mind about special status, because of this BJP people takes the advantage. This is so sad"
Ask him how Lokesh's assets are increased 24 times after Chandra babu naidu becomes CM of AP..
"what i’m saying..he may be the smartest politician but not smartest leader. he is an opportunist , cheater..etc 

so... he’s called the smartest politician"
Ask him how heritage share increased from 100 to 1000 after he become the  CM of AP..
"Like National parties, National media also behaving with superiority complex.."
He created Hi-Tech in Hyderabad. The heart of Hyderabad city
"Ask him how he got stays in 28 cases, never happened in the history of judiciary...ask him why CBI told they haven't had staff to search or investigate into illegal assessts case against Chandra babu naidu.."
"CBN it's not saying clearly, so he is great leader"
Waste leader in india
Ask him why moved out of Hyderabad even we AP people has right to rule from there..because of vote for note case..
"I'm very clear.,  I'm asking rights of the ppl,  is this federalism,  what I'm saying..... 
Biharted and came to Delhi...."
Arnab he is real hearo
He is playing politics... Never be trusted..
Please ask him why he betrayed the people of AP with false promises..why he didn't implement loan waiver program to farmers and dwakra groups..
He is cheater of AP
Arnab u dog...I admired a lot and used have huge respect on you...now after knowing that you have turned puppet in the hands of BJP and Modi I pitty myself for admiring you in the past...
Most corrupted and worst Politician in Indian History
nippu speaking like virendar sehwag.....
Please ask him what they did with 150000 crores in 4 years..every time he becomes cm AP went in debt and deep troubles...
i am thrilled by imagining arnab's reaction after reading these comments..    ....   andhra pradesh deserves naidu..... great leader
What I am saying...he will never forget this sentence

"I'm a common person in India, I'm an Indian."

We Southern people r very calm if any one touch our sentiment bjp will see southern End with India.
"This is a Stupid debate by a Stupid News Reader.
Mr.Naidu is clearly saying that BJP has assured Special STATUS to AP before elections and now BJP is not willing to give special status to AP , instead of debating on this point, Mr. Arnab wants to know whether Congress will provide special status to AP or not, what a crazy debate this stupid Arnab is doing here ?!"
"We from Karnataka We Support Mr .Naidu.
Modi do development instead of giving motivational speech"
dorikadu dongaa
"If u touch my integrity u will loss means the democracy will fail means nation will be in severe threat, at present situation is showing the picture of India"
No use from cbn.pawan kalyan is honest person.

"Cbn surrendered himself and state to bjp because of cases and corruption.As PAWAN KALYAN, the Newly emerged leader became against him by exposing his,his son's and his mla's corruption,now he is trying to raise the sentiment that bjp cheated us.Jagan also not able to bring SPECIAL STATUS to ap.Only PAWAN KALYAN can bring.Don't believe in cbn.He and his corruption is reason for today's situation of andhra Pradesh.Tdp-70% and BJP-30% shared in cheating ap"
Wt iam saying.. nee amma bazaaru lanjaaaa Kodaka.. shut ur assole n answer to wt u've been asked for but not the shit
CM avoided the answer to the question put to him regarding conversation between him and the PM.  that is Chandra babu naidu
Arnab you have wasted valuable time speaking with cbn ...As he wasted all the time enjoying power for 4 years in NDA now as it's an election year he started election politics and he accepted for special package and took u trun for special status....
I have my own language pride
14th finance commission has come on 2015 and the special status is promised on 2014 why they laid this to postpone this
"I challenge CBN ,can CBN give interview with out ""what I am saying""."
"Mr.Arnab its not about he has trust on rahul gandhi or not,dont be such biased journalist,ask him why  PM didn't provide his special status.you need to ask the rulling party why did he didnt keep any  promise.you are not here for anti congress mission.or you think the same for Congress mukt bharat."
"CBN is visionary leader in dng corruption.. cheating people of Ap..giving fake promises..first CBN should stand on his promises wat he stated in his party manifesto n should question others.Wat he had done all the years rather than questioning BJP He praised bjp even vefire 6months and accepted for spl package nw raising voice for spl status only for  political reasons.Even we People of ANDHRA PRADESH are happy that our  politicians are afraid of people.WE SUCCEED on that.Even CBN is the real culprit.WE DEMAND SPECIAL CATEGORY STATUS TO  ANDHRA PRADESH.
BJP made clear injustice to us.BJP there's time for u. Give SCS to AP else u too face heat as Congress.DOWN DOWN BJP,TDP,NDA."
"CBN is a visionary. 
Modi is lucky that cbn is not intersted in national politics. 
CBN is a grand master at his game and modi is a bacha before him. 
Modi will be ruined on social media by guys from his province who are big shots all over the world"
Political legend once he steps in history repeats
What iam saying iam 40 years industry .
If u respect my culture then only India will united India
"Arnab has his head far up Modi's ass, just like Pronoy Roy's is up Sonia Gandhi's. Both the Congress and BJP are corrupt to the core and so is today's media. Think before you vote"
Lanjaaaa Kodaka arnab adigedi enti nuvvu chepthondi enti raa bajaaru lanjaaaa Kodaka
This country is United states of India. Not India.
CBN IS GOOD POLITICIAN
Pm candidate..jai CBN...
"Arnab always blame Congress 
I m seeing all his debates 
And it's clear that Arnab wants to blame Congress."
Ur the bajana bajana wala in democracy
Mr Naidu dear Ex CM.. as you said I was a fan of you till this video. You lost it coz of your this cheap trick . You are saying that BJP before polls promised and they are not full filling it. How many of your promises to AP people before of your were delivered?
"Avoiding the critical questions but giving a big lecture about the past that seems to be a strategy or call it smartness or visionary!!! What I'm saying :P He knows since day 1 that SCS is not possible but he did nothing in the AP; all failed manifesto promises (one job to the household, failed pension and loan waive program, Dwakra). Then an immense corruption in any project from Polavaram to Real estate. This is his vision. From the beginning, I am clear or this is clear; what I'm saying !!!"
World's best mother fuckker chembu babu naidu
what i am saying is....i was sleeping for last 4 years
And don't test my Nationalists I'm a pure Nationalist
Modi hatavo south india bachavo...
Big bluff master..
Each time CBN says he developed Hyderabad he will lose Telangana support
"Mr goswami! we need u r support to AP for special status. We are beleving u can make this news very big in national level, goswami Plz plz support to AP"
Modi is the worst p.m I have ever seen..
"Mr Arnab #Bjp #Congress both r same agenda against southern India #Rupublic TV also same, I'm not favour of any political situation at southern India. But ur also a # Bjp bajana bajana TV My conclusions is #Dravidanadu we will one day"
Very sincere politician in words ..  # AP NEEDS SPECIAL CATEGORY STATUS
"Nothing except
What I'm saying is...
What I'm saying is ....
What I'm saying is ....
What I'm saying is ....
What I'm saying is ..."
"Again what I am saying , what I am saying"
Super naidu
Jagan great
What I am saying....what I am saying....What I am saying...but nothing your saying
"Ahh sensiority ,credibility ,commitment .if u have all the above then why did TDP contest elections independently right from 1998 onwards."
Jai arnab... Ji
Wha i am saying... U should stop this dialogue...
What am saying.. It is very clearly
modi hataoo Andhrapradesh bachaoo
Naidu his leader
Best  c m in india
What arnab is trying to say is PLEASE blame congress and say good about BJP
What u said to AP people JOB RAVALI ANTE BABU RAVALi.big lier
"Don't required to see entire interview.. people of AP well knows to his answers. Whatever you ask, same set of answers.. boasting himself as 40 years politics.. Modi don't do anything, Jagan, .. How come this guy survived 40 years in politics. how do he speaks all nonsense.. Whatever he spoke, speaking all contradictory.. he was happy with Special package, now again special status?  This guy was keep telling BJP did so much until 2018, now he is against BJP. Cannt this visionary guy predict in 1st year of alliance that BJP can not give any benefits to AP.  Then How can he claims that he is visionary, genius person and developed hyderabad, entire IT industry, coach for PV SINDU, mentor of Satya Nadella? F**ker don't ask questions anymore, its your time to answer not only Arnab, entire AP people. Last 20 years entire world has been trasfermating from cradle light education to digital education, manual work to robotics, no phone to smart phones, and may areas. Fortunately combined AP has been incredible talent and gained lot of companies, not by seeing this Bollu Babu. If he claims that he build hyd or IT in hyd, that showed his ignorance and pride...... Forget all past, if you feel you are great, genuine 40 exp guy and you are really fighting for people  of AP, then stay there in Delhi  and fast yourself(alone) until Special Status comes or die for this good cause. Then people believe that you are fighting for good cause, if not, people already realized your cheap politics except your caste group. Your caste group knows only praise you, they are just dump and  do not realize whats entire AP loosing because of CBN cunning politics."
we demand Andhrapradesh reorganisation act implimentaion it's right off Andhrapradesh people we support a vissionery leadership of Andhrapradesh CM
It is very clearly...
"You should have asked him why he accepted special package over special status. If he feels BJP has done nothing to AP what about this party promises in their manifesto,what have they fulfilled. What promises these people have fulfilled.
Total loan waiver
Employment to at least one person from each house and so on....
Yes well said he is a smart politician he has turned the whole scene towards Delhi and 2019 elections will be fought on just special category status in AP.
This person stopped people to protest for special category status by deploying huge number of polices in Vizag.
He warned parents not to send their children to protest for SCS or else cases will be kept on them.
Now because scs has become a huge sentiment of people he asks for SCS over special package.
He and his party praised the FM and congratulated him on special package now they change sides.
Not even one promise made by him has been fulfilled in AP.
The youth of AP are reeling with unemployment. Fatima college students have gone through a lot. Everything is temporary in the capital.
I really feel bad why a smart politician has become like this. It has been a disastrous 4 years"
worst cm in india
Abba u don't have any  matter to say any thing
Another drama by CBN by dodging all questions
"U don't no how to tell answer while starting.what I am saying ,what I am saying"
Chandra babu is a very clever politicians and pulled out because people are against BJP. He can not blame BJP because he was also part of the government and waited full 4 years.  Babu always won elections with the help of others and never contested by himself..he is very clever but people realized his cowardness.
naidu wl be no more in future. we andhra ppl lost trust  in tdp babu. he made andhra is big corrupted state.
"For 4 years, u supported for special package, and all of a sudden U woke up wanting special category status just because opposition leader is fighting for special status... pure political game.... push the blame on BJP for ur failures in AP..."
Big chor .what about vote ku note case
babu has lost trust in andhra people. he has promised  somany things to state in 2014 elections.
Mr arnab goswami please here my political point and analyisis Chandra babu Naidu tried to black mail NDA keeping in view ensuing two thousand ninteen elections but breaking connections with NDA has boomeranged on him Kerala Karnataka Tamil Nadu Telangana won't support his front north states excepting perhaps Bengali leader shall not support him the very idea of special status to a southern state is anethama to north so Naidu by calling the bluff is now between the devil and the deep sea and his political career is doomed
A paid journalist interviewing the MOST CORRUPT CM in India
The real Leader - CBN...Great man..
"@narendramodi @PMOIndiamade false promises to the States and cheated #AP

#StopModi #BadLeaderofIndia"
Anyways AP people are not going to support him in 2019. He made us fool by giving fake promises
what he is saying is scrap :)
what a English#  u old fellow Go to Home
Nippu ikkada.....
he is waste politician i have ever scene...till one month he said we dont need SCS ....he said his state having two digit growth in gdp while country in one digit ...most comedy politician
Caste feeling cm of ap
Chandra Babu Slept For Four Years  And He Criticised People Asking Special Status Now because of Pawankalyan nd jagan he is doing publicity stunt
what our cm can is told is absolutely correct pls support ap
Hello U Turn Uncle.. Nee Sodi aapu swamy
Em ra babji vadu emi aduguthunadu....nuvu em chesthunav ra 40years u turn uncle
the central govt..should implement  the bifurcation act.
"As per my opinion, Mr. Naidu, you have done a big mistake. The time will give you the real answer. You leave NDA, that's fine, that is your own right. But many people unable to understand how you bring 'No Confidence Motion' against the Govt. and waste number of days of Parliament business soon after TDP left NDA. You know very well the limitations of the Govt. In spite of that you have bargained a lot, but failed to achieve. The future will tell the people of the country your original motive behind this."
What i am trying to say is....Babu is a thief and we are not ready to believe both TDP and BJP parties...Worst fellows...
Richest politician of India
AP requires JUSTICE...
CBN is the CM who has great vision and PM should learn a lot from him.....
NOW AP IS CALLED SCAMES ANDHRA PRADESH
What iam saying my son is DAL
Arnab no 1 big fan of you
"CBN told to people that he will bring special category status..to AP in 2014.now it is your responsibility to bring status. Don't blame others for your failures. You diverted funds, you wasted funds for costly maintenance, you wasted funds for temporary buildings, temporary projects like pattiseema..now finally showing your original .cunning kamma nature.."
Richest CM in country takes 7 crore loan to build home in hyderabad and asks people to come to Andhra...The family stays in Park Hyatt for a year while the house is being built.. Uses private jets for all visits..And now says the state is poor..
I am a senior most criminal...
Where Arnab studied journalism
You know nothing except what I am saying and what I am asking... And he is talking about credibility..he never won elections without any allience. And he betrayed his own father-in-law and became CM. He says he developed Hyderabad.. yes he developed  already delveoped- Hyderabad. he is liar.  when ever he comes to power there will be no rains and farmers committ suicides.God knows the reason
Chandrababu is only person to fight against modi. Nobody in in India can with modi. Ycp completely bent to modi due their cases
"TDP under the Leadership of Cbn Garu is bound to ANSWER to the COMMON n ALLL PEOPLE of AP what his Government did with CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS ???! Cbn is doing all this now because he don't want to spend MONEY from his POCKET in the Upcoming GENERAL ELECTIONS 2019... #WakeupYOUNGINDIANS, No future if these kind of Old stupid selfish politicians QUIT !!! No Development to common People in AP, No JOBSSSS"
"Arnab is Idiot everyone knows that.He is the BJP supporter he always supported BJP.I am from TELANGANA I support our AP ,Our Telugu brother.......jai Telangana."
CBN is cunning polician to gain power. NO govt schools & hospitals are developed. Waited for 4.5 years and now blamin center for no progress in Andhra
total 10-15 channels expect 1 or 2 all yellow media
He is Corrup..
Arnab you are smart journalist
ap tdp tax sperate in state all mla will get tax ........
ARNAB OVERACTION. PLEASE ARNAB SUPPORT ANDHRA PRADESH PEOPLE. WE ARE IN INDIA OR NOT.
You better talk to him in low volume the same way you talk to yogi and modi
Is he asking question on AP or questioning the credibility of rahul gandhi?
all mla of tdp occiped land example uma .......vizag scam amravati ..........b.com phy vadu kuda
Jai Chandra Babu Naidu
It's historical chance to Indian people's to fight for present BJP party corruption please fight for Andra Pradesh special status also..
There is no leader of a bigger and better stature than chandrababu... proud to have him as our cm!!! appreciate his courage to take on Modi...this is the storm that the country is waiting for and once again it's tdp that's coming to the rescue of national politics
yellow rajyam in ap one wine ower must  tdp mla tax 10 lacks per month
ARNAB PAID MAN BJP. MODI CHEATED ANDHRA PRADESH PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY MODHI GOVERNMENT.
how much kamma property groing 227% all lands in amravati giving to kammas low cost poor farmers gave land
Do you believe rahul gandhi? What kind of question is that? This guy surely is selling BJP agenda
Chandrababu naidu great leader in India
"No one takes credit for Bangalore, Chennai and other cities which are better in IT. IT is because of the availability of the skilled resources, location, whether, people being broadminded... I bet you can't convert Amaravathi to half of Hyderabad in next 20 years because of caste politics, hot weather... That being the truth why do you make tall promises."
Devudaaaa....vaadu em aduguthunnadu nuv em cheptunnav Babu....idi ma karma ra babu
CBN is sincere & intelligent politician.
Mr Chandler babu naidu remembered u r the basically Hindu
"we just support cbn.If both congress and modi are useless, corrupt and ridiculous, then what will chandrababu will do? also remember one thing modi will see his fall fown surely 2019 , it is better to have chandrababu naidu as PM . he is capable of handling this country better than modi 1000 times. He is the firstvperson to bring the concept of outsourcing IT and convinced US companies to come to india and today becoz of that millions of people are employed....so Arnab please stop suppirting useless modi and start question8ng yourself"
Chandhrababu is a great leader better than modi
"what modi govt achieved by demonstration of 500 and thousand 

how much black money they get back"
tdp dongala party ..........modi  onl y modii........... mood vasti package election comes status
Jail JAGAN REDDY is aligned with BJP so to escape from the cases regarding his illegal assets .
Madarchoddddd Bhosdikee Arnab
Central Govt has to implement AP reorganisation act in true letter and spirit without playing vote bank politics
babu has lost his credentials. anti-cong party tdp is going to alliance with congress in 2019.
"AP is financially deficit and assets were divided as is now and debts were allocated on the peoples percentage. And power was distributed on a utilization basis. And AP has no level playing field with its surrounding states. Each and every surrounding state has their own way of funding with major cities like hyderabad, chennai, bangalore. Every time when BJP is in power they will collect all the funds from the people in the form of taxes and they will not distribute those funds in the fair manner. when congress comes to power they will loot those public funds. I think there is an understanding between BJP and Congress in allocating the taxes in between themselves. And If you see the center is collection of taxes and distribution of funds to south states is 1:0.4 and for northern states it is 1:1.6 . How do you think it is viable? This is the reason all the south states are fighting with the center all the time. BJP small state policy is killing the integrity of the country. They are killing the federal spirit of the country."
babu is never a sincere politician. he is always do backstabbing politics. he did backstabbing politics. as a anti cong babbu is going to alliance with congress in 2019.
1980's English ..we have to adjust
"Simple question, why didn't you ask for SCS in your previous 29 visits to Delhi?"
r nab oka bokkagadu vadi kanna pedda bokkagadu cbn
"Are suwar ka bache arnab let him talk  , cbn is dynamic leader in india,"
Bjp & Congress cheated AP.
ppl of andhra doesnt have trust in babu. babu is going  to alliance with congress is not acceptable by andhra people.  babu took somany U turns to his for future.
"What CBN is doing from last 4 years, because of caste based politics in andra reddy, kamma,  kapu....they will divided by Andrea and rayalseema"
"BJP AGENT , ARNAB"
"Arnab simply wants this to hear from cbn "" I dont support congress""."
We are all supporting u sir please  continue with fight against PM
"A.P Pupil are not Believe the 
U turn leader"
babu is a big lier. he went delhi to do his future politics not for ap benefits.
Legend..
"Mr.Modi....just be aside for 2 years . Or give make in India to NCB.
U can learn what is make in India actually means to the country. from Nayudu."
babu has lost his credentials in india. he told that he will never invite modi into andhra in 1995. but again he has journeyed with modi. now babu telling lies.
If u have guts have the same kind of debate with our cm(EPS).
"CBN is the backstabber man
Dont trust him anymore"
"Mr.Hanumanth Rao,if you lose everything. What will be your first thing to embrace?? Your own identity and Self respect for you. That is what CBN done."
"Modi  cheated Andra predesh... #AgentArnab is trying to turn the wind towards congress.. Hw pathetic... TDP is in alliance with BJP because MODI given promises.. As all of his other promises it also vaporized...

#AgentArnab is interested in making NAIDU say i am  anti congress.. #AgentArnab is exposed..  #AgentArnab congress betrayed in 2013... BJP shattered the entire dream of andra in 2018.. Which is more hurtfull.."
U turn leader
Best cm in India
so vote for BJP in AP
"arnab, babu has cheated ap people by his false promises given in 2014. total free babu."
Modi will do justice to AP if CBN is not CM
"What the CBN is telling totally bluffing
In AP politics will be changed by Power star pawan kalyan
PK is the real and honest politician in india like Ex tripura CM Manik sarkar"
Arnab sir pls try to keep your qsns short..
"Among the current choices, CBN is the best choice for the development of AP.
In these 4 years, we got Isuzu motors, KIA motors, Hero Motors, Xiaomi, Celkon Mobiles, Jio Mobile factory, Ashok Leyland, Google X, Franklin Templeton, HCL, Apollo tyres, Hyundai group Logistics, Bharat Forge, TVS brakes ltd, and many more. 
We know under whose leadership jobs will come and development takes place. Every Panchayat has a CC road now, they completed Pattiseema Project in record time and saved the crops in Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts and diverted Srisailam water to rayalaseema through Handrineeva, so that industries could come up in Anantapur and other rayalaseema districts. 
Regarding jobs, companies do business and they don't want fools to work at their plants and factories. It is our responsibility to use the opportunities provided by the state Govt and improve ourselves and develop our skills. Otherwise, even if 1000 companies come, we wont be landing up in any job. 
Runa maafi was a bit unsuccessful due to inadequacy of funds and he is rightly demanding the centre now to fulfill the promises made in the act."
Cbn could have avoided pulling out because when he was down bjp lent the helping hand.this theory of special status will certainly help big  political families.
Who told u guys to seperate and demand justice u people are gamers
He was asked by IAS Mussori students to come and address them. Most of them are choosen by them. He went n explained about adminstration
"Modi is the only visionary prime minister of incredible India and only hope for our legendary country at present time. Corrupted leader are joining together to stop Modi tusnami. Whether Modi wins or loses the election he won my heart. I support NAMO. I am from Andhra Pradesh but a bit disappointed by Modiji action on Andhra Pradesh. I personally feel BJP will not win 2019 elections in Andhra Pradesh unless CM corruption is proved by BJP. We don't have other choice except CBN. So inspite of corruption he is a top priority for Andhra people. Because CBN is a good administrator people surely support him I guess. But I support Modi in center. CBN is a smart player who can change the minds of people by hook or crook and doing it all time. I feel in 2019 election again Modiji will come to power and the same CBN will join BJP because he doesn't have any choice. As I feel in politics no permanent friends or no permanent enemies and it best suit for CBN to catch feet or hair...both are same for him.
-  Jai hind"
Sir pls keep debate with tdp ministers and people on live
"Punch padindi CBN kii ,dongaa"
"A cunning fox never speaks truth, its history is all about backstabbings, betrayals and you know whom im talking about. Arun jaitley made the exact statement right from 2014 about SCS, what happened then? why were you silent? and now why this cheap politics? and you call yourself sr most politician in India? lol....... just wait for one year and you will be good to go, pack your bags already mr. singapore naidu."

Listen to videos what Bill gates talk about him.....
He is inspiration to what real communication skills are..... it's not just English."
Mr naidu failed to show real spendings which doesn’t match with state governments spendings on paper with reality on ground. Now he wants more funds released. Mr naidu clearly failed in that. And bjp failed to full fill special category status. There is basic difference between special status vs package is self sustaining on self utilisation of tax free investments in development vs being puppets of money package on which ever party as central government. Now special status is must to Andhra and 14th commission should be scraped if it’s in way of Andhra Pradesh. No compromise. I would suggest bjp to separate from tdp and go to Andhra Pradesh elections in full strength by declaring special status to people of Andhra Pradesh
All these things
I am supporting Naidu
What I am saying
Ferformance
"People commenting his english.... first try to know about him..
He is book of administrative principles and study his qualities and know how many hours he work, how he has gone thru problems became soo much successfull."
Our people had briefed me
What I'm saying
"What I am saying I am very cunning, I am senior most I know very  well how to play and backstab, same thing I did in Hyd, I put into hyd world map before Nizam and kakatiya rulers, I know how escape from Vote for cash , what i am the best in all"
We need special status to AP we support AP mp s
CBN is good and best leader in India
CBN always great
ACCHE DHIN STARTS
Special Status only possible through Jagan he is leader
#CBN is a great leader
Jai Jagan
"BJP cheated to ap people , CBN is a great leader"
You don't say anything...... Without what am saying......
ARVINDGOSWAMI UNDERSTANDTHEPAINOFANDHRA\
Only modi great
BJP betrayed people of AP not CM AP. BJP played wicked politics to force CM AP get out. CM  worked hard to develop state. He run state on loan expecting funds from center. In this year budget also centre not provided required funds. CM approached 29 times with list of 19 items still to be fulfilled besides special status. Still TDP have hold in both Telugu state. TDP is trusted partner to BJP.  BJP may be wanted  some other partners  lootes like P chidambaram in the state. Let us see what happens.
"Orey VP we have 10 years common capital of Hyderabad, your caught by vote for cash and running into Amaravati"
He is not able to answer any one question straightly
No more bjp will come into power in 2019
"TYPICAL AP MORONS  DEFENDING  NAIDU HA HA
HAPPY SAAMBAARAA,CHATNI"
BJP is miserably failing in solving the National problems and  disapponting Indians who thought Modi can deliver when he came to power. The Democratic institutions of India are becomming useless. if this is the case India canl be devided in future.Hope better sense prevails our politicians.
Again what iam saying
"Govt. sends 50K crore to Kashmir alone as central grant every year.
10K to even small NE state like Meghalaya as central grant.
Even though none of these kashmir valley leeches and disturbed because of christian secessionist NE states pay any indirect taxes to central govt. as they have been special category states since decades.

And this does not includes the thousands of crore that Army has to spend in these areas.
Rather transfer these grants to states which need it like AP right now. 
But AP asking for special category status to not pay indirect tax is unreasonable demand as it will only hamper its competitiveness in long run. AP is too big to not pay any taxes and industry shud move there bec. of good governance of Naidu not bec. of tax free area. It is like turning whole state into tax free SEZ which will only lead to no revenues for central and state govt.

If the govt. transfers this grant money from leeches states like Kashmir to deserving states then no issues like current finance commission issue raised by southern states."
Aa English entra Nayana since 40 years industry
AP SUCKS big time.....
Why don't they make Hydrabad joint captial ? like chandigarh
He is the great leader in indian and modi is not even ward member candidate.
Chandrababu naidu seems tie up with Sharad Pawar as he Supriya PAwar was welcoming Chandra babu
"Most Corrupted CM, and Opportunist Politician"
What I'm Saying
Your are super CBN
Mr. Naidu...the bifurcation act said that you can use Hyderabad for Ten years and meanwhile you can develop Amarawathi  in Ten years .... why did you run away in the first year only... the very bad decision and you are the reason for all this debacle.
whatever it is AP should get their right..... btw i am not from andhra
"Yeah. AP doesn't wants to pay any indirect tax. It wants to compare itself to north east or newly carved hilly states.
Unlike those states AP was already industrialised with big ports. That's the difference which these politicians are not telling. The exemption from Indirect tax is given to get new industries not just on the basis of divison of states otherwise even telngana will qualify. Rolling back the exemption after few yrs means flight of industry so the AP ppl even don't know what they r asking.

The best course will be to take away the 50k crore grant that govt. sends to leeches of kashmir valley and give it to AP for few yrs."
The leader forever for a.p
Now what I AM saying....fuckers politicians have divided into smaller state...why??? So they loot the common people...pretty soon...We have 60 states...

He is an Effective Administrator, he brought all IT companies to Hyd,city that created 7lakh direct indirect jobs in his tenure..Isn't it fair enough? Some ppl may throw stones at him now but they will be grateful to him in future."
