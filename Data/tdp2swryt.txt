b'Ya Congress divided the state without a proper way so people of AP we opposed it and elected BJP and even this party did the same and hence again the party who was the reason for dividing saying that they will rectify it so it s not that we have to support one party always we need to support a party which makes our state to develop so now CBN is in a view to give a chance again to congress'

b'As a common man I feel AP is deceived by both the National Parties Special package is also not implemented Unfortunately rd front is not an alternative UPA is not the wish of majority We may have to see NDA again but finally the state would be at loss People are diverted from real issues by regional parties in the state'
b'What a Typical politician is CBN isn\xe2\x80\x99t he Blaming central govt for everything What was he did in the span of years He said earlier that special package is boon for AP not special status He knows everything he is the main culprit for this entire drama Being honourable CM of AP he can\xe2\x80\x99t backstab his own people This is truely rediculous and blocking the precious parliamentary sessions for this is not beneficial to anybody'

b'I am not very much into politics friends I am just eager to know if some one can explain to me so that I can learn AP is asking just what has been promised to it Is it wrong I am asking in unbiased tone so kindly don t take me wrong Let s say AP is the richest state then why was it promised special status and asked to get bifurcated Should it not been told before that You are the richest state in India you will not get special status What is fair my friends As I told you I am not here to fight or argue Kindly explain me if you have patience Thank you'
b'Mr CBN wht were you doing all these years you are a cunning jack as elections are heading you started to play all these dramas see what i am saying is shut ur mouth and be honest to the people who has elected you U r the only senior politician in India who is cunning and the only politician people of AP not going to believe you anymore You were caught in a case for MLC election in Telangana and ran away from Hyderabad U were afraid of cases and bowed yourself and whole state before central government'

b'Chandrababa Naidu should become the PM then India will progress in better ways'
b'Wt iam saying'
b'By this debate Mr Naidu could not understand what Mr Arnab asking or he himself hiding the fact that he would like to make a partnership with congress in future Very clever Naidu I thought Mr Naidu is being heavily humiliated by BJP leaders by nor caring him that is what led him to propagate at National level otherwise he won t Needlessly say that he is senior but he could not get respect even for his endeavoured work Could Andhra Pradesh people give him second chance A billion dollar question'
b'AP lost its capital twice To all who oppose AP SCS please get yourselves kicked from your capital twice and see how it will be in a new state with no capital and huge fiscal deficit I suppose Bihar UP etc were also part of India in what made you not to oppose SCS in because at that time you were busy imposing unscientific bifurcation on us'

b'He may not have absolute majority but when it comes to under Modi\xe2\x80\x99s negative wave this united front can play a key role in dividing the votes Then with his support the govt would be able to gain a formation This is not a normal strategy pls try to understand It\xe2\x80\x99s not Rahul Gandhi Its Chandra babu Naidu'
b'BJP and TDP together made the AP Bi furcation act as a big joke All AP People knew this Like arnab said How come a senior politician like CBN can not predict what BJP gonna do Besides CBN has taken the Special Package instead of Special Status Its all about power politics making AP people fools for AP special status will become manifesto for every political party'

b'AP is financially deficit and assets were divided as is now and debts were allocated on the peoples percentage And power was distributed on a utilization basis And AP has no level playing field with its surrounding states Each and every surrounding state has their own way of funding with major cities like hyderabad chennai bangalore Every time when BJP is in power they will collect all the funds from the people in the form of taxes and they will not distribute those funds in the fair manner when congress comes to power they will loot those public funds I think there is an understanding between BJP and Congress in allocating the taxes in between themselves And If you see the center is collection of taxes and distribution of funds to south states is and for northern states it is How do you think it is viable This is the reason all the south states are fighting with the center all the time BJP small state policy is killing the integrity of the country They are killing the federal spirit of the country'

b'And this does not includes the thousands of crore that Army has to spend in these areas'

b'But AP asking for special category status to not pay indirect tax is unreasonable demand as it will only hamper its competitiveness in long run AP is too big to not pay any taxes and industry shud move there bec of good governance of Naidu not bec of tax free area It is like turning whole state into tax free SEZ which will only lead to no revenues for central and state govt'

b'whatever it is AP should get their right btw i am not from andhra'
b'Yeah AP doesn t wants to pay any indirect tax It wants to compare itself to north east or newly carved hilly states'
b'Unlike those states AP was already industrialised with big ports That s the difference which these politicians are not telling The exemption from Indirect tax is given to get new industries not just on the basis of divison of states otherwise even telngana will qualify Rolling back the exemption after few yrs means flight of industry so the AP ppl even don t know what they r asking'

b'BJP has cheated all the way to Andhra pradesh people Don t trust people Modi s Government CBN is great leader who struggling to develop his state Andhra Pradesh'
b'What I am saying'
b'Good Interview at right time'
b'I m from andhra Chandrababu Naidu is a bluffmaster and relies on his mediamade image and self publicty to potray himself as visionary People outside of andhra get wow ed by his power point presentations and exaggerated talk but reality is that in mid s he said he will transform then united Andhra pradesh state into Japan Korea if he gets the mandate ANd he got yrs mandate and he consturcted hitech city in hyd ingoring rest of the state and ran real estate racket around it As a aresult his party got decimated badly in he blamed vajpayee modi advani gujarat riots for his defeat BUt he never got elected back for yrs Now under special circumstances like state divison he went to the newly formed left over andhra pradesh state after dvision and asked them votes saying he is experienced guy and in this dire hour of need the state needs his experience Also Modi supported him along with Telugu top star pawan kalyan Inspite of all that this guy won only with vote difference His party in Telangana which had strong cadre completely got wiped out with no presence now So currently AP the divided state is his last bastion Once he got elected he again started selling real estate dreams in the name of Amravati and after he failed to get any traction on that and with minimal progress he started panicking and now along with strong regional media support is painting BJP as villains for all his failures He is playing emotional drama on daily basis In AP assembly he drove away oppostion Oppositon no longer attends any sessions Only himself and his party they spend hours on daily basis running emotional show blaming BJP raking in telugu emotions playing victims talking north south divide instigating hatred on BJP etc So people outside of Andhra dont get too excited This guy s countdown has started'
b'THAT IS CBN'
b'CBN garu great visionary leader AP ppl should be United like neighbor tamilians shud always support regional parties remb before United AP elections were decisive for Congress party for terms in return State was bifurcated as a gift to the ppl now the present govt is no better than the previous hope this time AP citizens will vote sensibly weighing the merits of national regional parties which brings development and prosperity to the state'
b'The perfect answers great leader'
b'I can t find genuineness in the statements of Chief Minister As senior Politician he should have known the wicked heart of BJP leaders at the initial stage of He enjoyed the power for four and half years uninterruptedly in collusion with BJP top leaders with dark hidden agreements pertaining to pattu seema projects and polavaram projects He accepted at the outset the special package introduced by Modi which has no legal validity in the parliament He tried to convince the people of AP that special package is good to AP in lieu of Special Status He clutched the agitations or protests raised by opposite parties in A P in earlier years Now how can he take U turn and Who will trust him'
b'He is the true leader from AP Just imagine same injustice happens to Gujarat people they will kill all the people in the nation like godra incident under the vision of great leader Modi That is the difference between south and North Indian people There is no basic dharma in North leaders all are decedents from king Kamsa Make South India as separate nation'

b'years experience of cbn saved kamma community by choosing strong base region of his community kamma i e amaravathi he saved his community and betrayed whole andhra people so he is betrayer of andhra and saviour of kamma community hats off cbn for saving ur community kammma'
b'Ok looking at the comments there are some wrong viewpoints Firstly the reason CBN is asking after years is because for the first time it was categorically stated that they will not provide special status Second it has to be understood that Modi IS NOT THE LEADER OF BJP Modi is categorically an exceptional leader who could stabilize our economy and bring about fantastic foreign relations which though often ridiculed is a pivotal role Congerss s year rule saw one of the most stagant economy and high scale corruption and Rahul Gandhi is a chimp who resorts to insults rather than proper politics more like Trump That said I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT INJUSTICE WAS DONE TO ANDHRA It will be amazing if we see a Federal Front leaded by CBN considering his exceptional work and experience'
b'Cbn betrayed andhra and saved his kamma community'
b'Rajdeep the one and only truth is chandra babu naidu is CM for his community kamma caste that is why he chose strong base for kamma caste his caste amaravathi as capital for andhra cbn is community based Cm if u r kamma caste cbn is CM other than kamma caste he is the A betrayer for andhra god save andhra cbn saved kammma communiry'
