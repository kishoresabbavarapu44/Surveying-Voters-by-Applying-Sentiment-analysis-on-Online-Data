Pawan the man for ap
It’s been a pleasure to see your speeches like this ..jai hind Jai janasena ....
PAWANKALYAN SIR IS WELL HUMAN BEING AND KIND HEARTED PERSON...HE DID A LOT OF INITIATIVES BEFORE CAME INTO POLITICS
Real leader p1
Jai janasena jai jai jai
"He is great person ,soon he will develop AP ,he don't need any power like CM to develop ."
What an English sir
"This shows how foolish AP people are, because of people like this India is still in this position...

3 Parties are fighting for power, and no one party thoughts match with others two. That's the reason Democratic countries like India will never ever get developed.. It's wise to leave this country rather than being between foolish pubic"
We are now only trusting and lots of hope's on you..
To be honest I was a Loksatta(JP) member earlier. Seeing CBN's hardwork and dedication towards AP development attracted me. At this age he is working like 28 years young. I m not requesting people of AP to vote for CBN. I will leave it to your Karma. Decide who you want? One bad decission will change your life upside down. Dont vote for criminals and 420's. beware and be vigilant.
thu thu thu thu antav m ra
Jai pk Jai janasena ✊✊✊
Jai PsPk and Jai hind..
He himself told bjp has to pay 75ooo crores to Ap through FFC .but suddenly he took U TURN...
Pawan kalyn acting according to the instructions by Bjp.....
"For what is his admiration for ? Is it for ditching AP or failing to fulfill the promised manifesto or for all the unfair activities towards AP? Pavan is contradicting his own fight for Ap status. When both BJP and TDP are responsible for this situation ,his pointing fingers at only  one party shows that he is not open."
One and only hope leader in Andhra PAWAN KALYAN ✊
Jai Janasena
"He is such a great, honest, humanist, True person and leaders. Jai Janasena"
Jai powerstar

Pawankalyan garu antho mandiki sahayam chesaru athani valla Anno kutumbalu santhosanga unnayi proud to have this type of great human in our country
"He is not new to political arena and making these kind of statements. He did same when his brother started PRP and later merged with Congress. He now started something of his own and merged with BJP. He has no stance, except rhetoric which adds value to his bargain. He runs a social media army for 2 objectives. 1. Go after whoever exposes his true nature 2. popularize him in public. He takes names like Che, Castro, all national, international leaders depending on situation but when anyone questions about his values, he escapes and tell its personal attack. He tells he bought a land for 40lakhs where it sells over 6-7cr and gives evidence of registration value, like any other citizen, leader. If you are honest, tell the truth. This man has no ethics nor morals. People have decided to bring Jagan to power no matter what."
Pawan Kalyan's speeches are good to listen but useless in execution!
", centre state chepadaniki gap undi antunaru, Mari JFC enduku pettaru oorike time pass ka. He is weak leader don't believe in him. Always changing words"
Jai  ma Annya  PS  PK
He is the honest politician we thankfully have
"Dear national media, he never be clear in his mind, he is not able to study the current issues, don't make him popular."
Inconsistent
✊✊

"Getting applause .. haha how silly it is .. if you observe u r speech and the way the people reacted that time. it is very much understandable that they not listening to the context that u r delivering ok ... when you had spoken some stuff in English, some of the people were silent because they doesn't even  know what u r talking about and what u r pointing at .. and if u see the time when u said "" PAWAN KALYAN "" or some other stuff in telugu they are shouting like any thing... what that mean .. they just came to shout and show their devotee nature on u .. that's all and nothing much ..."
Jai powerstar
Pawan kalyan jai janasena jai hind
Honest leader
Jai Janasena.. we want honest politics..no more giving  impossible promises in election agenda and backstab later.
Pawan Kalyan does not know real life is not the same as reel life. He talks against corruption and does not clarify on how he got Rs.15 crores worth of land for Rs. 20 lakhs for his new house. He couldn't even speak fluently in telugu.
After 4 years his open the eye.ha...
He never gave explanation why his brother had sold the earlier party to Congress.. Why So?? .Now he wants to make a modified version and sell it to BJP??
Best human being in Telugu states
He is the real leader in Andhra Pradesh
"Pawan Kalyan's speeches are good to listen but useless in execution. He thinks he has a right to put baseless allegations on any one, but when it comes to him he is so concerned about his pseudo image and he can't take any criticism . ...Highly egoistic with double standards"

I'm big fan of pawan but for the scale of my state my soul force me to share such words...
Hurting for others but pawan do not stands on his words .... He think political scenario as film...

Chandrababu Naidu is the most corrupt leader in the country. His son Lokesh is indulged in heavy corruption in Andhra Pradesh.
Good guy but very confused soul.
Puppt in hands of BJP
True leader
Questioning TDP and BJP after 4 years is NOT HELPFUL.  After he understood that People are angry with TDP and BJP.. He changed his stand.. This is not for people. This step he took is purely for the Survival of his party.
People leader Pawan Kalyan next cm in ap
Pawan kalyan is cheap and worst fellow from andhra he is always in dreams he dont have even knowledge in politics
Kalyan babu english kummesaru.....
He is the best leader for people because he is always thinking about society.
So silly it's his drama with Bjp....He is an opportunistic politician....Both the parties in Ap are working for Ncm but he is silent...Waste fellow

"Da way Pawan going always increases people standard of living and political accountability and responsibility

"i have noticed that a lot of celebrities have became politicians in Southern states like Tamil nadu, Andhra Pradesh."
Chirranjeevi is a bigger star but he is very soft-spoken and down to earth
"Power star war begins
He is God of Andhra Pradesh."
"Speeches-BJP.
Scams - INC
Service - JS.
Choose wisely."
"Jai Pawan Kalyan...
Jai Jana Sena"
I feel like he is an 'opportunist'....Not consistent in his viewpoint..plz Correct me if I'm wrong.
Jai PK
Pawankalyan the real leader
