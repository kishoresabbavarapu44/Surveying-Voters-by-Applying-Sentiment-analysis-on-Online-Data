"Everybody should understand the turning point is vote for note case.  He lost credibility and BJP played that card.  Four years he accepted for special assistance once Jagan took the special status issue, CBN felt threat and started asking special status."
Naidu is father of corruption in our country. What justice he will do for ap people. He will justice for his caste & tdp people only. People hate these corrupted politicians.
"CBN is dedicated hardworking leader.He dont know dirty politics like Amith sha and Modi.Modi spoiling AP,creating Dirty politics using corrupted leaders like jagan & pavan.I pray God  No BJP in AP.God bless INDIA"
Even National media has fear of NDA to telecast the AP issues
The NDA is still cheating AP by giving promises but not implementing them. How many years they need to execute the bifurcation act in AP. Four years passed and this is fifth year still they are saying we will give you special assistance. Telugu people are very angry on NDA and they will not get even 1 seat deposit in 2019 elections
"The shah chief of national party, dashhed a letter to AP CM of funds & cheques releasing which was denied by state CM or government. & Branding as   political gains  & not for the development .
My question is why Mr shah, PM, FM, did not announce in floor of the house or grant earlier when MR NAIDU was making numerous trips to DELHI.
It is very clear & transperant that the central government headed by Modi, Betrayed the development of ANDHRA PRADESH & back stabing the interst of the people.
The Nation ever gave the clear mandate in past as a dictator, but for a PRIME MINISTER.
Konw modi  & shah combine delivering as the dictators.
As the common people of our nation a staright question to the jounalists, buerocrates, do you all think what is MR Modi & his government doing is RIGHT?"
C Naidu save country is drama .save Telugu dasham party
We are very proud  boz we have leader like you sir. Pls go to Center and save india
what I am saying
Worest CM of AP history.
4 years waited for modi( PM ) help to AP PEOPLES DEMANDS. JAI TDP
In 2019 tdp win
What a fuckin English Mr Naidu. I wonder how did u became CM of AP.
"Chandra Babu is a heartless Power Abuser ,twister of truth ,destruct-or of lives ,livelihoods and Environment but a crooked manipulator who uses officials even at Central Government to do frauds but keep records managed to escape from Legal Systems .He uses certain NGOs and henchmen to attract even Bill Gates,attend Economic Summit, to hoodwink the people of AP and claim whatever happened in India or Hyderabad is due to him .He is a self boasting man.Can't medias ask him,how he created ""Heritage Foods""misusing the position as Chief Minister and amassed wealth.Why he left the BJP after four years,just to manage local sentiments and come back to power and loot Andhra Pradesh and perpetuate his fraudulent managements by killing sincere and genuine people and create more Government sponsored NGOs and tap all funds including CSR funds for his henchmen.He appoint IAS officials even after retirement to protect his interests through RSS formed by him with ulterior motives .He use his officials to make fabricated reports to UN and attract appreciation.He doesn't have the primary conscious to do justice to people who loved his own Party except his selfish interests"
"First you stop sand mining scams in ap,capital region land scam,you yourself were caught in a scam offering note for vote you are corrupt cm of India"

"If CBN is so serious about the special status, then why did the same CBN said earlier that special status is a waste, and accepted the special package also, is n't he accountable for changing his statement."
Cbn sir taken wise decision before 2019 Elections.. These incidences will help in AP coming elections..
Mosam.vennu potu naidu only one.credit goes to cbn

What am I telling !?????
People of AP pls change your view on CBN..it’s high time u realise what sort of politics he resorts to just before elections!! You may curse me but you’ll never grow as a state till u change ur minds!! Once he was in support to special package n now just before elections he says I need special status..! Do you still think he’s the one who can change AP?? To remind you all a single thing more is if AP is growing at 10+ more percentage which is more than country’s average how on earth is AP eligible for a special status category??
We are with u sir always and forever

Sir I am from ap Chandra Babu Naidu ........is the main reason for injustice of ap ..............cheater ........!!!!!!!!
It is not correct  he is fighting on behalf of 5 crore people. He is fighting only for him self and his costar.
"Is there any body in poor telugu media. To question  naidu, like the question beeing asked by  Raj deep sardesai  and  anable goswamy? So poor is the telugu media. Or sold out?."
"Saredesai sir, @27:00 know the history properly before interviewing. CBN is representing 50 million people, so respect and remember that. Sarcasm @27:05 is uncalled."
"Issue is good. Interview is good, A powerful politician and experience politician is there. All qtn went well. But still some thing to be exploited in this interview. AP should get their share as per constitution and as promised by the centre. Now this subject required some more pit should be filled."
"CHANDRA BABU NAIDU GARU IS  positive protagonist on BEHALF OF  total ANDHRA PRADESH for the growth whole ANDHRA, WE ARE WITH YOU SIR! We hope that ANDHRA PRADESH will have a golden future under the presence of NAIDU GARU in forth coming elections 2019."
You all viewers. Just know one thing. whatever done by modi just done for india. Just check his family what they are?. If you see cbn. He spend people money and none of you can not even talk to his driver. Just see Yogi in UP. We need leader with no family and no affection. Only way to fix issues in india. Cbn must know the basic. NEITHER DECEIVE OR DECEIVED. Indian voters need only leaders who are rich.
BJP has cheated all the way to Andhra pradesh people. Don't trust people Modi's Government. CBN is great leader who struggling to develop his state Andhra Pradesh.
What I am saying.
Good Interview at right time
"I'm from andhra. Chandrababu Naidu is a bluffmaster and relies on his mediamade image and self publicty to potray himself as visionary. People outside of andhra get wow'ed by his power point presentations and exaggerated talk but reality is that in mid -90s he said he will transform then united Andhra pradesh state into Japan ,Korea if he gets the mandate. ANd he got 10yrs mandate, and he consturcted hitech city in hyd  ingoring rest of the state and ran real estate racket around it. As a aresult his party got decimated badly in 2004, he blamed vajpayee, modi, advani gujarat riots for his defeat. BUt he never got elected back for 10yrs. Now under special circumstances like state divison he went to the newly formed -left over andhra pradesh state(after dvision) and asked them votes saying he is experienced guy and in this dire hour of need  the state needs his experience. Also Modi supported him along with Telugu top star pawan kalyan.Inspite of all that this guy won only with 1% vote difference.His party in Telangana(which had strong cadre) completely got wiped out with no presence now. So currently AP(the divided state) is his last bastion. Once he got elected, he again started selling real estate dreams in the name of Amravati and after he failed to get any traction on that and with minimal progress, he started panicking and now along with strong regional media support is painting BJP as villains for all his failures. He is playing emotional drama on daily basis. In AP assembly he drove away oppostion. Oppositon no longer attends any sessions. Only himself and his party they spend hours on daily basis running emotional show, blaming BJP, raking in telugu emotions, playing victims, talking north south divide, instigating hatred on BJP etc. So people outside of Andhra dont get too excited. This guy's countdown has started."
THAT IS CBN
"CBN garu, great visionary leader, AP ppl should be United, like neighbor tamilians, shud always support regional parties, remb before 2014, United AP elections were decisive for Congress party for 2 terms, in return. State was bifurcated as a gift to the ppl, now the present govt is no better than the previous, hope this time AP citizens will vote sensibly, weighing the merits of national/regional parties, which brings development and prosperity to the state."
"The perfect answers , great leader #CBN"
"I can't find genuineness in the statements of Chief Minister. As senior Politician, he should have known the wicked heart of BJP leaders  at the initial stage of 2014. He enjoyed the power for four and half years uninterruptedly  in collusion with BJP top leaders with dark  hidden agreements pertaining to pattu seema projects and polavaram projects.He accepted at  the outset the special package  introduced by Modi which has no legal validity in the parliament. He tried  to convince the people of AP that special  package  is good to  AP in lieu of Special Status. He clutched  the agitations or protests  raised  by opposite  parties  in A.P. in earlier years. Now how  can he take  U turn and Who will trust him."
"He is the true leader from AP. Just imagine same injustice happens to Gujarat people, they will kill all the people in the nation like godra incident, under the vision of great leader Modi. That is the difference between south and North Indian people . There is no basic dharma in North leaders , all are decedents from king Kamsa . Make South India as separate nation.

Country division will resolve most of the Bharat/India issues. North Indians are enjoying with free money and family business and looting nation in the name Bharat mata blah blah. They are not doing anything to nation other than casting vote and looting tax money. South Indians are following all rules and education and jobs. After the education they are going out of country with no proper jobs in India . If south become separate nation it will generate somany jobs and innovation and growth for future generations."
"Jai CBN

CBN is great leader
Bjp had started betraying a  long time ago. Cbn is ready to be betrayed again if the elections were not near. One of the best  to use the media in his own way for support
Two of the biggest bastards against India's progress and Modi's work in just four years!  Shame on both of you!
"Good interview by Rajdeep Sardesai. The entire world knows Congress and BJP have done injustice to Andhra. While Congress done injustice by doing bifurcation of a prosperous state, now  BJP cheated again by not implementing promises made in the bifurcation act. 2500 crores for Sardar Statue in Gujarat and 1500 crores for building a capitol in Andhra? Can any one build a capitol with this money? People of Andhra waited patiently for four years and came to know the dirty mind of BJP.  we are not asking any favors. We are asking only what is promised in bifurcation act. People of Andhra feel betrayed by BJP. CBN supported Shri Vajpayee govt  refusing 5 cabinet posts with 29 MPs and  without seeking even one minister for 5 years. He had chance to become PM twice but never opted for power. But this is fight for Truth and Truth prevails.  Now govt machinery is being misused by BJP to route regional parties and non BJP parties like Shivsena, TDP, Trinamool, DMK. AIADMK was made a puppet by PM Modi. Coercion politics wont work. MODI ji and AmitShah should shred the mentality of MY India Or No India. We have example of Indiraji who followed the same arrogance. Cooperative federalism is give and take. It is like Unity in Diversity and Center as head should protect this environment. BJP will loose Karnatak elections. 2019 BJP will loose elections. Even a China war bogie before elections cant save them. Just imagine a prosperous state of Maharastra is bifurcated in to three states what will happen? Will the people rights get effected or not? BJP even with majority in parliament could not face a non confidence motions. What a shame. Black day for democracy. A PM who visits follows Gandhi and visits Sabarmati every time should think at least once about what happened in parliament why the members voice was not heard and suppressed colluding with AIADMK."
Rajdeep and cbn both of you have spiritual ethics ? You sat in front of a lord ganesh idel with shoe's.
CBN is useless CM in India.. because of his own benefits.. he cheet Andra Pradesh..
Trying to fool national media now RIP CBN
bjp down down
Modi IS FRAUD
CBN is playing this card because ..he got a hint that he will be sent notices from CBI for the corruption he accused of ..in Building capital funds misuse.....
Rajdeep is talking like an ass hole. State is divided and needs support for development as the exchequer is nill at the time of division. Jai Chandrababu Naidu
"PM :  Modi, has a properties of 1.26 crores ........... CM : Chandra babu  has poperties of 177 crores. Who is working for people ?? Who should we support ??????????????????"
"Huge corruption in a.p, He seasonally"
CBN experience spoiled a.p
"MODI GOVT, LIES MORE."
MODI CHEATED ALL IS SUPPORTERS.
"This is new form of reservation :

SC ST STATES: UP, Bihar etc gets more very good central fund even they give very less revenue to country.

OBC states: Gujarat and maharastra  gets good central fund and give medium output .

General category states: Karnataka, tamil nadu , Keral , Andra-telangana, gives great amount of revenue to nation but gets nothing from central.

What a unfair policy by central government:
Atleast Ambedkar reservation is bit justifiable since there was reason.
This Modi reservation is totally selfish stupidity which destroy the whole economy of the country.

Central government is punishing South India for showing discipline and development.

And central government is rewarding the states which did corruption  and showed  indiscipline in following the policy and population control  and showed lack of progress.

This is very bad message for the beaurocrates and citizens who are willing to show the progress. Because they will be penalised at the end."
"Why can't political parties bring 1000 people to Delhi and do a hunger strike. Instead of spending crores of rupees during election campaigns, why can't they spend train tickets to and fro to Delhi and do hunger strike if they really want A.P status. (Instead of bringing people to their political meetings by giving them 200/400 rupees). By bringing people to Delhi, all parties and media will give support. And center can move further on A.P special status. Once the movement gets successful, the whole state should honor the people who did hunger strike."
Chandra babu is failure cm.he is a lier and cheater.AP people won't believe Chandra babu.we didnt saw worst cm like chandra baabu. CBN is a U-Turn uncle.AP people are looking for dynamic young leader JAGAN.
After note band....hope all the Indians got 12 to 15 lakhs into their account(I have just put a single promise here).. Betray= BJP.... Wake up indians
Make CBN PM and see the difference in our Nation.
Cag an independent body reported that Andhra tops corruption...in each and every govt projects and schemes.. Fight for Andhra status not for CM seat
he is bane to Telugus/Ap. He did not get the Hyderbad revunue sharing which KCR was ready to give before split
money was not given to his contractor lobby. that is why he is crying. He make sure that all yellow media tell his lies
40 years experience of cbn saved kamma community by choosing strong base region of his community kamma ..i.e amaravathi..he saved his community and betrayed whole andhra people...so he is betrayer of andhra and saviour of kamma community..hats off cbn for saving ur community kammma....
"Ok looking at the comments there are some wrong viewpoints. Firstly, the reason CBN is asking after 4 years is because for the first time it was categorically stated that they will not provide special status. Second, it has to be understood that 'Modi' IS NOT THE LEADER OF BJP. Modi is categorically an exceptional leader who could stabilize our economy and bring about fantastic foreign relations which, though often ridiculed, is a pivotal role. Congerss's 10 year rule saw one of the most stagant economy and high scale corruption and Rahul Gandhi is a chimp who resorts to insults rather than proper politics--more like Trump. That said, I DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT INJUSTICE WAS DONE TO ANDHRA. It will be amazing if we see a Federal Front leaded by CBN considering his exceptional work and experience."
Cbn betrayed andhra and saved his kamma community....
Rajdeep the one and only truth is chandra babu naidu is CM for his community kamma caste..that is why he chose strong base for kamma caste his caste amaravathi as capital for andhra...cbn is community based Cm .if u r kamma caste cbn is CM..other than kamma caste ..he is the A1 betrayer for andhra..god save andhra...cbn saved kammma communiry
Shame to see cbn is playing with words.. it shows lack of confidence on himself
Cbn is smarter politicians not a good leader... see how he is answering to the questions raised
Cbn and modi both are same way to cheat Indian people
"first change the anchor, he is confusing the cm. Not only now, in all interviews he is trying to discourage south."
CBN is a leader vision and mission!
We support Mamata benerji
"Rajiv sardesaii totally confused CBN
But CBN answered very genuinely"
"Yes u statement exactly right
We are strongly supported to CBN"
We are strongly supported to CBN
"Ap demonds justice
Not in justice
Modii creative cheater
Mitra drohii
Guru drohii
2019 Modii go to Gujarat"
Mr.Naidu doesnt have clarity on what he wants? Special status? package? or what else?
"CBN rocks, one n only visionary CM in India, CEO of Andhra....
Jai CBN...."
Naidu saab.. aap mahaan ho! Perfect counters to Rajdeep's stupid questions. Rajdeep ki bolthi bandh
Naidu is smart guy but I wonder why he is not answering the questions directly.
I absolutely disagree with you rajdeep modi is a tourist Pm not a powerful pm he just does justice to north .ore than south I hope u remember wat hpnd in 2006
Gallilo kaadu PK and Jagan delhilo maatladaali
"CBN Is  big opportunist in the entire country .. now BJP kind of loosing momentum , he is separated apart and blaming  BJP .. he did not speak single word about special status past 4 yrs .."
what the hell u did till 2018? Jagan is the next CM TDP is a failed scam  party . Modi is PM he has given what was promised
It is universal truth that AP has not been done justice ..... but  I Feel Mr.Chandra Babu Naidu is not answering the questions if the National Media....
"He's always bluffing........Maybe Modi did wrong to AP but CBN is a part of it. He never answered a single question straight forward. Politicians are like that, but he's ( CBN ) king in bluffing. He spoke different in AP and different in National media. I want Modi or Amit shah to respond to this bluff  master CBN....."
M.L.A and M.p elections are different from local body elections..Y.S.R party didn't have grass roots as well established  T.D.P and  Congress you won bcoz of modi wave and Pawan Kalyan.. perfect opportunist..yes B.J.P should have done better than it should have been
"Great Cbn make Sania,saina,sindhu,srikanth..............................don't underestimate him he is on of alltime greatest leader of india"
CBN ia a dynamic LEADER
Jai Andhrapradesh Jai C. B. N
"I don't know about why CBN joined BJP ,but we people of Andhra voted for TDP and BJP because of modi and Pawan Kalyan . We believed that MODI will help Andhra . We are thrown out of Hyderabad without having capital . We state is divided  Andhra got debts and Telangana got properties .
We voted for BJP because we thought BJP will fulfill burification act properly . No capital ,lot of unemployment is generated . So we need special assistance for build our capital and special status (EAP+industrial incentives) . 
Now AP is fighting for self respect . This time BJP will be washed out of whole South Indian like Congress wiped out last time  . It won't get deposit votes also ."
"This shows how foolish AP people are, because of people like this India is still in this position...

3 Parties are fighting for power, and no one party thoughts match with other two. That's the reason Democratic countries like India will never ever get developed.. It's wise to leave this country rather than being between foolish pubic"
"Mr.modi cheat not only people of ANDHRA Pradesh but also people of India then why we part in this Indian nation.he built bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad with 100000 crore but Mr.modi have been give only 1000 crore to AP capital this is correct.
Mr.modi think that i am only perfect gentleman in this India and all are based on the modi to live
I request the whole nation first see modi body language and eyes he don't have minimum courtesy and he also cheat ADVANI ji, who give more support him.
I am challenging Mr.modi if u have real courage first u contest in SOUTHINDIA then u see power of south Indians."
great leader
Cbn  ...seems to to be dont have vision .......falthu manageble politician only
"what i am saying, what i am saying, what i am saying........."
Good PM candidate
People of india...pls listen his words and visionary.. He is the great leader and cheated by ur cheater called modi and bjp..and he will never sit back...He will hitback very strongly...
Had AP snapped at BJP earlier  Polavaram proj would not have even started?  Now it is 55% complete and cannot be stopped now. CM has to look at so many things.
"I respect & loved Chandra babu for his work for development. My request, he would've been more clear about explaining our challenges. What BJP is doing to us. Plz use strong words or liners which shld catch attention of national media. I noticed, not to loose patience & dont angry on media"
Modi is the worst leader for BJP.
Jai CBN
We support Ap cm because he doing well for Ap. And also he have more experience.
We want next pm is cbn
"CB you joker, you betrayed India, by holding hands of India's enemies like momta"
ferformance
all those dislikers (YSR/BJP) chenchas and luchas .. middle finger to you..
Super cool and good cbn cm
Jai CBN.. We are with u sir.. .best CM in India forever
"No funds forcapital 
no spl status 
no spl Railway zone at Vishakhapatnam 
non implementation of AP reorganisation Act is not injustice to AP state"
Naidu is great valuble political leader in india
Totally failure modi govt
Cbn is great vision leader
Next pm Naidu
Bjp is loss in ap elections  2019 bjp promise is not fulfill in ap
Ap cm very good in development
I believe #Modi is a great leader before Elections then he promised @trupathi  election meet in presence of lord Venkateswara but now he proved that he is a politican by #betraying #Andhra pradesh
HE IS CHEATING AP PEOPLE MORE THAN MODI.. HE IS A FRAUD...
why did you develop only Hyderabad Mr.CBN? Isn't it your failure to neglect the entire state and develop only Hyderabad? This is true for bangalore also.. Tomorrow Bangalore gets separated from Karnataka rest of the state does not have anything..
Cbn is great
chandra babu betrayed ap people
why did you accepted package......from there onwards all these complications have started.....why didn't you asked bjp about special status all these 4 years.....we have voted you for development and capital city...where are all those...I think its time foh your retirement....we need tdp free state....
support cbn
Jai cbn
Rajddep should interview Modi. He might puncture the whole vikas
"good debate , nice to see CBN answering critic"
We stand for Development and we stand for our cause. We support our CM.
BABU IS RIGHT
"I respect this leader, for the kind of clarity in his thoughts and commitment he has for the Telugu people !!"
Atleast cbn went to national media  for spreading bjp cheap tricks...where jagan and pavan kalyan...
We are with you CBN sir
"CBN cheated Andhra Pradesh people and Modi . Don't believe him. He cheated NTR founder of TDP while he was in Congress.
Cheater Babu Naidu.
Ask any Telugu person you will get to know about his cheater personality"
Chuthiya host and chuthiya cm
He is the correct person for Indian politics right now.
"I always get pity on Sardesai  
Because when he talks it seems to me he is crying"
Greatest chief ministers of AP are NTR YSR Chandra Babu Naidu... Leaving corruption charges against ysr....who brought social welfare schemes and development ...
Justice has to be done to the AP.
NAIDU IS A VISIONARY LEADER
I am proud of you Mr. Chandra Babu Naidu! May God bless you and the people of Andhra Pradesh in your fight against injustice to the State of Andhra Pradesh!!
"If only these demands and words were of Nitish Kumar !!!
But he is finished now"
Great CM sir...we are proud to have a leader like you...
Bjp won 2014 beacuse of modi and now will lose in2019 because of modi
"Modi is waste fellow, doing nothing. He is just using CBI, Income tax, ED departments on political rivals."
CBN is Great leader in country.
"When babuji demands special category state, he think people are fools."
"How many years it will take to finalise the designs for assembly, high court, secratariat."
"What I am saying lies, no funds in ap but I will go any where to hire a special flight"
The furfose is that you were caught in note for vote Ferformance ...
He has great vision. At almost 70 he does not use spectacles
"He got a chance to become PM and with the numbers TDP has i wonder who offered him that seat if it was not to be NDA with BJP holding the maximum, so where is the question of betrayal, he could have done much better for AP being a PM but he refused and he is fooling people of AP with shallow points that his dedication towards AP is the only motto he has."
"CBN thought he can again arm twist with BJP but unlike Atal ji's government he got Modi in front and now he has fallen flat on his face, try and make some more political grounds, it will help you in next election, the panic of TDP is on upsurge, now he is squared in his own conspiracy and he has two sided rivalry his ego of being in politics for more than 40 years will give him the oppositions responsibility very soon"
"Time for CBN sir to retire,
He is unable to justify the questions.
CBN sir please don't remind of nda1 , as u accused modi in 2003 and u promised he would be arrested if arrived in Hyd.
10 years past u forgot everything and hailed him as Messiah of India.... Now after 4 years modi again became villain."
AP Bifurcation Act should be implemented in letter & spirit as well as Assurances in Rajya Sabha by the then PM ManMohan Singh.
"Modi has approved 80,000 crores for Ahmadabad bullet train. but only gave 1,500 crores for capital construction."
"Rajdeep you are an idiot, you’re not getting his point"
"""what I am saying is..."" repeat mode hahahaha"
Modi govt should deliver their promises made to AP state at least now... otherwise they will become the dark mark alongside the upa govt in the history of both AP and India...
super CBN....but chala late ga ...lechav...because of PK... pressure....all the best CBN....go head we are witb u....
Basterd first he has to learn english
"Next elections TDP vs YSRCP + BJP + Pawan Kalyan combo, even if they contest elections separately YSR party and Pawan Kalyan support BJP after elections."
Modi betrayed Andhra people
"Great move by Naidu pulling out Support to NDA, If he get all MP Seats in 2019 elections, he can repeat the Magic.Numbers paly the key role. People of AP should realize this, till that time Central Govt. treats us like slaves.Come on AP Youth spread this news in a big way."
total my rating is 0000000000000...thanking you
i love india today but your questions are not good..generlist blame and try to miss lead cbn...
"naidu sir,tell i came here for justice of andra problems....you asked more question about politics only..?
all questions is given by bjp or yours won..?"
"who given questions to india today?
we will respect india today,you will loose my respect"
all questions made by india today or bjp?
"why you asked political questions....plese understand andra problems
i hate india todaay it self"
"questions asked about political way,not for ap development
anchor is try to divert main issue.that is not good manner to india today"
CBN always focussed for AP development. Telugu people are only known to rest of India because of him . He deserves much more
"If someone is not answering a simple and straight forward question, there's either no honesty in the opinion or there's something to hide."
We all understand that Andhra Pradesh is going through the difficult period politically..but remember these leaders are seriously not concern about the state .fact of the matter is as the election is round the corner this gentleman is playing cards ..both the nda and the tdp equally responsible for the injustice ..why was he silent all these years despite the fact that it's nothing to do with special package ignoring special category status ..
"what I am saying what I am telling ...

rest in piece English"
CBN is big fraud.. He didn't do anything to the state.. He is started acting after 4 years
"@29:00 minute ; Babu said he is fighting on his own all the time...well...well. How about 2014??? U are in power just bcz of PAWAN KALYAN garu, Janasena party(Peoples Army Party) other Jagan  Mohan Reddy would have been the CM. Go n learn English kiddo"
"CBN ... he is that one great administrator mother India has produced. The way he looks at the issues, the way he deals with the issues, the way he handles the most toughest times..hats off sir.. we love you n support u"
"Modi won due to Congress fail only ... CBN is a Leader and he inspired the people worldwide by his dedication, hard working , Future thinking and innovative"
What I am saying
"BJP is a failure govt, No opposition party must support BJP .modi is a hopeless leader."
What I am saying is!! Non sense guy of the decade.. if you got the majority why you bought opposition MLAs.. and why he slept 4years?  Only answer is What I am saying.. what I am asking.
What I am saying cbn is worst fellow of india
Naidu has done big mistake by joining BJP .The same mistake is going to done by Jagan .AP will be in great problem.
Justice has to be done for Andhrapradesh state
As a andhra men I am very proud because of this great visionary leader is our chief minister he can fight against conspiracy of bjp behalf of andha
CBN is great great great CM and the best CM India can ever have
Worrest  CM ( He don't have dareness and dynamism)
AP CM ..worst CM in India.. He has no credibility in Ap..he doesn't win atleast 4 mp seats in 2019 elections
AP PEOPLE had good clarity about him. mr. nippu naidu first implement all 600 promises what you promised before 2014.
"CBN is a corrupt, completely diverted central funds. The Architect firm from Japan who were responsible to design the state gave up on the contact and declined to work with AP state GOV. A whole article is published in JAP media on how corrupt AP GOV is.  AP stands # 1 corruption in whole of India , rated # 1 in ""least likely to business with""  in economic survey. People who praise are mostly caste biased and reluctant lovers of TDP. Now whole new drama in national media to fool them."
"CBN 
Role Model In Indian Politics"
We r with u sir
"What I am saying :):):)

If you visited 29 times and why can’t u stop after 10 times and tell Ap people that why can’t we do agitation and in next 2 years we get special status

In 29 times have u discussed your personal purposes. Everybody get same doubt

 what hell you telling people and if you are not transparent how we can believe u

Hello cbn answer on issues not about your 40 years Experience"
What i am saying....asking
Who's this amitsha
CBN is great person
The great leader to built great amaravathi
What I am Asking
What I am saying
He will not become next CM. How will he become PM.
This guy talks like Mr;Perfect.. practically fully corrupted with Telugu yellow media support.
As a NDA prime minister candidate modi ji promised special catogery status for AP in a public meeting in 2014. Ex prime minister  manmohan singh promised special catogery status for AP on floor of house(rajyasabha) 2014 feb 20th at the time of united AP bifurcation. AP people are just asking to implement promises made by them and implement AP reorganisation ACT 2014
Congress murdered Andhra ! Bjp has been brutally raping new born state from last four years . Now people from AP want to book nirbaya Case on BJP in 2019 elections..
He is opportunistic politician
CBN is our great leader .
Speaking truly and fights for justice.Cbn is the best cm in the indian history till now.
"CBN is ideal leader not like chaiwala.
1)He developed HYDERABAD
2) TRANSPORTATION
3) connected RIVERS for irrigation even in drought areas
4)many companies in AP
    a) mobile production
    b) automobile manufacturing
   c)24 hrs current
5) Recovered VIZAG from deadly HODDOD Toofan with in one year
6)Penction for old age,widows
7)Talli-Bidda express for pregnant women.
8)No religious fights in his rule
9)where ever Telugu people are in trouble, he will give his helping hand.(other state or country)



LEGENDARY LEADER."
I support next election federal government...!!!!I think need to be change our mind set
"Chandrababu is better than chaiwala. Modi want to supress south India by 15 finance commission.
1) Making south regional parties weak in central.
2) collect huge tax from south capitals, in return give nothing.
3) Make issues,fights between Muslims & Hindus.
4)Want to spoil southstates and destabilizing local parties to gain power

#South Indians are not fools like north.Mind it MODI(CHAIWALA)

@WHAT ELSE WE HAVE TO EXPECT FROM CHAIWALA."
"So what else chaiwala (Modi) planning to do.lower class, middle class are in bad condition."
Mr Modi and amitcha very very big chiter in India
No1 dynamic good leadear AP CM chandrababu
World no1 best best CM chandrababu
What im saying Bjp hatao india ko bachao jai telangana jai kcr
"CBN fails to explain the injustice by Centre to AP.. just blabbering.. he knows, if he goes to 2019 election with BJP, Muslims of AP will not vote for CBN and will go to Jagan.. his reason for leaving NDA is sickularism.. nothing else"
Super question sir
"Jai Andhrapradesh., Jai CBN"
Justice to be done to the new state...
He demands central for Additional Revenue for his family & party development.. But not for AP development....
"CBN is the most ""selfish leader"" in AP politics... He looses his credibility by doing indefinite corruption in last 4years...."
10% growth then why special status
Fk English
Visionary leader.... Commitment leader
Jai TDP Jai CBN we want special status.... We want justice
He (AP) deserves SCS
He is best CM of India
He is the person who works hard for AP State ... We trust you sir...
MODI  IS  BIG  CHEATER . HE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EVEN MLA ALSIO..
Jai cbn we are always with you sir...
"Bjp , congress and this English and Hindi media are not understanding the agony of Andhra people as none of them need votes or viewers from Andhra."
Jai CBN
BJP cheaters of Andhra Pradesh
RIP BJP
Sir u asked questions on behalf of bjp u must be questioned more about andhraparadesh situation as well as people's feelings it's our right to get special status will modis promise will also be false
"King maker for 2019 , 1999 will repeat again."
I believe Modi is the worst PM in INDIAN history so far!
BJP betrayed people of ANDHRA PRADESH.... will teach lesson
While bifurcating Andhra pradesh both the national parties did great injustice to Andhra pradesh they even didn't not follow raja dharma
First of all let them give special status and 18 issues raised by the then opposition leader in the rajyasabha arun jaitly and venkaih naidu in rajyasabha .if they dont implement the parliament act people will loose confidence on our parliament and democracy
excellent CM
100%b.j.p betrayed Andhra Pradesh
"CBN is not responding to the question. My view is that these politicians are creating false hopes and creating false understanding about special status. I don’t believe such people. He is doing the wrong thing just to keep power in 2019, which will not happen. No one will get a clear majority in the next AP elections. The impact will be on people. Don’t support TDP or YRCP, they both are corrupt."
"But he failed in Jagan issue, a financial criminal still enjoying in his legacy"
"Cbn is most visionary leader in India,  what he implemented in ap,  later modi followed them in gujarat, even in financial crisis Cbn is working hard for the development of ap, nd bought kiyo nd hero companies to ap, but he is poor in communication"
The Legend CBN.
"Fraud to the core.... cb naidu......... death to tdp, congress,bjp....."
CBN ....4years waited with Patience to get  positive help hand from centre ...  but Modi ....cunning fox..... intentionally denied assistance to AP ..state betrayed by centre .. inexcusable
"Fraud to the core.... cb naidu......... death to tdp, congress,bjp....."
Cbn is great leader
what am saying????
Naidu is not cm of Andhra Pradesh . He is ceo of Andhra Pradesh
"The present situation for AP, is totally responsible of people of AP, once go back the political scenario and situations taken by the people of ap &as political leaders."
He betrayed his father in law..He betrayed BJP now...propagating false to Andhra people...He is interested in real estate business of members of his caste.*sic in Amaravathi...
AP people are blessed to have CBN
If he addresses a local media also even though his news highlights in international news this is his calliber
rajdeep screwing him so smoothly.
what is he repeating the same thing again and again. does not he have other scripts to talk. go ahead talk various issues not simply mummy daddy he hit me........
Leader of Andhra Pradesh Chandra Babu Naidu doing good job
"WHAT IAM SAYING..... ""VADU EMI ADIGINA VEEDU BATTI PATTINADE CHEPTADU"" THAT IS BOLLI BABU..."
This is the result of Modi's arrogance & Dictatorship..
Chandra babu may soon go to jail in vote for note scam
all positive comments here are being managed by tdp it wing ... i am sure they are going to respond to this comment ...
"Mr. Chandrababu is Chameleon, corrupt and an opportunist. You can see how many times he speculate his own statements. Never forget how he betrayed his own father in law and conquered the party members by bribing them. Now talking like a saint. NEVER TRUST CBN."
We want special category status status for Andhra Pradesh
He is himself priding...40 years industry
Why u dont ask jumping mla s to tdp from ysrcp.
"of course bjp and modi have cheated Ap by not giving promised special status. but this Naidu also took several u turns regarding special status. Naidu said no use of special status first and he said package is better. but he is forced to move no confidence motion as SCS is the interest of ap people. he should have done these steps before 2 years. he is opportunistic in his own way. but better late than never. hope modi will understand his mistake of fake promising. to the people out there, may be u don't follow ap politics. here naidu  is proved to be opportunistic and he is forced to move no confidence by the two opposition parties"
Jai tdp CBN
Hodha antey jailkey
Bjp govt. On  the indian people belive down example ap state take decision wrong so that
Neku cases levu ra puka 18stay lu techukunav
Anchor more focussing on politics rather than issues which r in ap reorganisation act I think this anchor supporting BJP
What I m saying what I am saying edhi thapaa em radha ra puka
No doubt CBN is best leader in INDIA
I am from telangana... I Support to ap Special Status...
What he is saying is very true and legitimate..centre must give what it should as per bifurcation act and its very sad modi ji is making people of andhra cry and feel insecure as the congress did.1 second ago•
Modi + kedi(Naidu)=bluffed all
Both Naidu and modi both are Biggest liers
Jai cbn
CBN is a legend
"B J P = Break Janata Promise |  B J P = Break Janata Promise  |  
BJP IS DEAD in A.P, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu & Telangana - for the injustice they have been doing to these states. What wrong did our people and our farmers did,  you show discrimination towards our problems and our hardships. You are concerned only about politics, not about the welfare of the states and national growth as a whole.

BJP is DEAD in entire SOUTH INDIA. This negligence to south Indian states will bring unrest and is harmful for the sovereignty of the nation. Hope they realize that soon."
"My dear fellow country men PLEASE SUPPORT US, the following promises were made by the Parliament to the state of A.P and were never fulfilled..

# First and foremost the SPECIAL STATUS, but not provided yet 
The following are the benefits of Special Status:
1. 90:10 in central assistance schemes
2. 90:10 in external aided projects
3. Revenue deficit gap funding
4. Tax incentives for industrial development 
All the above would have provided immense growth to state and better opportunities for the youth

OTHER COMMITMENTS MADE:
# Polavaram dam - The lifeline of our state (reimbursement of over 3000 crs are yet to be released, and Thousands of crores need for Relocation of people)
# Industrial Corridor from Chennai to Vizag (no progress)
# Vizag Railway Zone (no progress)
# Central assistance for Capital Construction (need several thousands of crores to build Legislative Assembly, Secretariat, High Court, Raj Bhavan, and basic infrastructure i.e. Roads, Utilities, Drainage, etc.)
# Kadapa Steel plant (no progress)
# Dugarajapatnam Port (no progress; if this location is not feasible alternative port)
# Central Institutions (only 556 crs given in the last 4 years out of 11600 crs needed), but they took lands worth over 11000 crores from the state
# Metro projects in Capital and Vizag (no progress)
# Kakinada Petro Chemical Complex
# Outer Ring Road for the Capital (Still in reports phase)
# Connectivity to the Capital from major regions in Rayalaseema and Nothern Andhra
# Division of assets (no progress)
# Division of debt between AP and Telangana (still 20,000 crores yet to be divided after 4 years, for which interest is raising)
# only 1050 crs have been given in the last 4 years as backward districts package promised out of 24000 crores in the lines of Bundelkhand package

AND THE LIST CONTINUES... (these are present in the 2014 A.P Reorganization Act, not what the people of Andhra are stating).

CAG has calculated the revenue deficit of 16000+ crs in 2014-15 and only close to 4000 crs has been given, that too in the last year after a long fight. What happened to rest of the 12000 crs?

Tax incentives are promised in the lines of Himachal Pradesh (100% excise, customs, IT etc.) but not given. 

Mr. Finance minister, I hope you are good in english, if not I would like you to go through the 14th finance commission document along with one English teacher and come to press to tell in what page did the commission recommended not to give Special status to A.P. 

If you say giving special status to A.P is not acceptable because other states would ask the same, then why did BJP & Congress bifurcate only A.P when several other states also want to get bifurcated?. WE ARE ONE NATION, we would never ask for Defense money to be spent in our state as you said.  

By repeating the same story in Parliament, you are fooling the people of A.P; but in the eyes of the whole nation you and your party are becoming Big FOOLs. BJP = Break Janata Promise | BJP = Break Janata Promise

If you want to check what were promised to Andhra Pradesh at the foot hills of Lord Balaji in Tirupati during last elections, please see the following video. None of those promises were fulfilled.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgIAE2a0WWE&t=2s

SPECIAL STATUS is not sentiment, it's about the commitment made on the floor of parliament. We want JUSTICE, and want our rights to be fulfilled. 
Justice DELAYED is Justice DENIED. JAIHIND!

Gr8 leader
Modi is a kid in front of naidu
Legend my babu garu and
Fraud babu
Best CM in India and please ask Modi to fulfill his promises
Why backward state not developing ? Still south to feed other state .
"CBN is one of the most hardworking and great leaders. He did not stay quietly without doing any development in Ap waiting for the money or co-operation that should come from central govt. He acted as an intelligent person for four years as he gave chance to the central govt to act and prove themselves. CBN has brought many companies and industries without the help of the central govt. We need People like CBN in politics if we want India to develop. 
I appeal to whole India that politics are different and development is different. Every state should develop like Ap. So center needs to give a helping hand when persons like CBN is working very hard. I am s/w engineer and I am proud to say that this is because of our Cheif minister CBN. Don't bring only politics into the picture leaving the development. I am ashamed to say that Modi is not developing the country but only doing politics in every state."
We support Ncbn he is exactly ryt about everything.bjp so called modi bjp betrayed Ap and also India
None of his answers are relevant. He is just trying to cover his mistakes of his govt by raising special status now instead earlier. he is a perfect cheater
Hez real..hez hard working ..he has developed Hyderabad..now this BJP is not supporting my CM..
modiji became DERA BABA FOR AP
"CBN might have different political strategies and other allegations regarding corruption but he always comes with genuine Developmental strategy as well. Once upon a time it's Information Technology and now it's ""Policy making for performing states and non performing states"", ""Competition among states towards development"". This can lead to appoint a ""PM who's a CM of highest growth rate recorded state"". Somewhere it's a new idea in India which is needed to make India a Developed Country by developing States too"
In anyone conducted public speaking competitions then BJP leaders will get 1st price.
We support our dynamic leader NCBN
Stop playing BJP band music interviewer.if ANYONE try to control or occupy us then you will see another Tsunami in or after 2019.MIND IT√
Naidu Good leader
what iam saying
The pm who talks about one nation and nation growth ditched AP state and its growth by denied the financial aid. How such PM  can have credibility to win re-elections who utterly ignored the commitments and following divisive policies
"Modi Chamaar ek atankwadi hai, Randi ki paidawar hai Modi, ab ki bar Modi ke gand maro"
"Sir your answers would have been better and agrresive. You might have informed them the BJP played delayed tactics by telling one or other thing every time, like one time special assistance  in place of  special  status or financial aid etc which you patiently waited for its fulfilment as you don't want to loose the relations with BJP as alliance. Can't we highlight the divisive policies playing by BJP with most of the their own allied govts everywhere in arrogant and cunning manner with ambitious interests to set up their BJP govts in every state. Modi govt just failed in their commitments and issuances given to State and people."
"In india we spend
 3600cr for shivaji status
3000cr for patel status
330cr for ram mandir
But 1500cr for AMARAVATI for captial city of Andhra Pradesh
Yes india will be 3rd biggest economy country in world"
Ap need justice. Parliament need to be stand on credibility
Such a good things came 1 is modi opposition one man and new  party in central is come in future
He should have left NDA when they rejected special status.Those days he was busy in lobbing for getting out from CASH FOR VOTE. Now he realised he could not come back to power due to his misschies and False promises which where never addresed.He had a plan to let his failure transferred to BJP. If they like to reopen case of him.He can use it to get  sympathy if he was prosecuted.
He is smartest politician in INDIA...so request to please be careful...
We are proud Chandra babu naidu garu
He is cheater
cbn he introduced Hyderabad to world.
"I'm questioning , only one thing, what I'm saying,  but many thing,  I'm very clear agenda, 
CBN is out of the way to answer Correctly. ...ha ha ha... Bla.. Bla..  Bla.."
"Honourable CM Naidu is just resorting to political stunt in view of the upcoming elections. He is unfairly blaming Modi government for his failures. What is his contribution to the people of Andhra Pradesh in the past 4 years; except illusionary promises??? Did the Honourable CM, who is an experienced political veteran since his young age, require over 4 years and 29 visits to Delhi to meet the PM to dawn upon him that the central government has been betraying the state of AP. 
Moreover, what were the MPs doing all this time that it requires the CM to personally visit Delhi so many times and go back empty handed. Parliamentary statistics show that the MPs of AP were the most unproductive ones. 
In conclusion, the blame is not of the Modi government, but of the MPs and CM of AP.
People are wise enough."
Naidu acche neta hai.
Modi and Shaah are opportunistic politicians. They keep on changing words from time to time and situation to situation. There is no fool in the  country to believe their words. We want the Leaders who serve the nation not the Dictators. They are taking the Law into their hand's. They are doing things according to what they want and wish not according to the will of the people.
cbn is dynamic leader we all support you
"As a bengali i feel bad for AP, the new state, they need a special support to build its capital city, like punjub got chandigarh after independence. CBN can be ideal opposition leader. he has done lots of thing with Atalji."
Mr Rajdeep ... Shame on ur biased journalism ... From the very beginning of the talk session u had repeatedly tried to impose ur own ideology on Mr C Naidu ... So many times u had been snubbed for ur rubbish way of conversation ... Still u r incorrigible ... Shame .
Great leader cbn in our nation.
Nice sir we are with you
What a great vision of a great leader..!!!!
Bjp is dangerous for not only south but also for whole country
Now slowly Naidu because of his extreme greed is going to loose in next elections and tdp graph shall hit lowest bottom.reddies shall re-emerge with the help of kapus and other neglected obcs and even dalits and Naidu will go into oblivion don't know whether in kuppam or Tirupati or vizag
For sure BJP is next congress in AP
"How come this guy survived 40 years in politics. how do he speaks all nonsense.. Whatever he spoke, speaking all contradictory.. he was happy with Special package, now again special status?  This guy was keep telling BJP did so much until 2018, now he is against BJP. Cannt this visionary guy predict in 1st year of alliance that BJP can not give any benefits to AP.  Then How can he claims that he is visionary, genius person and developed hyderabad, entire IT industry, coach for PV SINDU, mentor of Satya Nadella? F**ker don't ask questions anymore, its your time to answer not only to Raj, to entire AP people. Last 20 years entire world has been trasfermating from cradle light education to digital education, manual work to robotics, no phone to smart phones, and may areas. Fortunately combined AP has been incredible talent and attracted by lot of companies, but not by seeing this Bollu Babu. If he claims that he build hyd or IT in hyd, that showed his ignorance and pride...... Forget all past, if you feel you are great, genuine 40 exp guy and you are really fighting for people  of AP, then stay there in Delhi  and fast yourself(alone) until Special Status comes or die for this good cause. Then people believe that you are fighting for good cause, if not, people already realized your cheap politics except your caste group. Your caste group knows only praise you, they are just dump and  do not realize whats entire AP loosing because of CBN cunning politics."
Naidu is Aman without true conscience who betrayed the trust reposed by his own father in-law who wanted to curb the Reddy community and he and his party neglected Telangana region so Telangana separatist movement started and Chandrasekhar Rai spear headed the movement during ups regime andrha Pradesh got divided into Telangana and andrha neither congress nor BJP is responsible but this clever Naidu politician from andrha kept curbing thereddies and joined hands with. One after another national alliances finally with NDA started demanding extra money for devolopment and establishment  of a proper andrha state with capital inamravathi whatever and where has all the money given by NDA central govt gone all into whose pockets god knows the foolish NDA was under constant black mail for further funds from Naidu finally he wanted andrha Pradesh to be given special status meaning under article three seventy two too much black mail is too bad now having broken his ties with NDA the umbilical cord cut by himself he is running to mumta banarjee and all other useless north Indian entities and rabble rousers for help in desperation no southern party shall join his so called united front excepting hysterical bangali leader under whose front he will be burnt along with his tdp kcr now he feels my brother previously his enemy sorry still naidus enemy waiting in the wings if andrha gets special status kcr shall demand double special status followed by taminadu   Kerala Karnataka etc then a union of special status south Indian states these turn coat politicians all over India are ruling and India shall be in the dogs manger very soon
In 4 budgets they didn't give funds for  minimum requirements..Babu waited until last minuit with patience and Hope and faith on Mithradharma.. BJP goin to pay Big Price for it..
BJP cheated AP People very badly
Kill BJP fascists and prostitutes.
"People are with you CBN sir, everyone knows about modi dirty cheap politics."
Big leadership
"*APJ Abdul Kalam saying about NCBN: 
As I was walking back, Prof A Kalanidhi, the vice chancellor of Anna University, joined me. He said that my office had received many telephone calls during the day and someone was frantically trying to get in touch with me. As soon as I reached my rooms, I found the telephone was ringing. When I answered, a voice on the other end said, ‘The prime minister wants to talk to you.’

While I was waiting to be connected to the PM, Chandrababu Naidu, who was the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, called me on my cellphone. He told me to expect an important call from the prime minister, adding, PLEASE DON'T SAY NO

While I was talking to Naidu, the call from Atal Bihari Vajpayee materialized*"

Mr. Rajdeep can you tell me on what basis Andhra Pradesh is been bifurcated from Telangana ??? before questioning our Andhra CM...
No 1 opportunist politician   in India

"All Telugu people MUST boycott Elections, If Center fails to fulfill its promises made during bifurcation. DON'T cast your VOTE to any party TTP/BJP/CON/JS/YCP/Others... Stay at Home... rip congress rip bjp"

Modi BJP Stop Spreading lies and controlling National Media and cheating 5cr Andhra people
"With not much support from central govt., AP Govt. has attracted companies to start in AP. Few among are as below.

1. Car - Made in Andhra(Kia, Isuzu), 
2. Bus & Truck - Made in Andhra(Ashok leyland),
3. Bike - Made in Andhra(Hero motor Corp), 
4. Batteries - Made in Andhra(Amar Raja), 
5. Tyres - Made in Andhra( Apollo Tyres)
6. Mobile - Made in Andhra( Xioami, ASUS, Micromax, Celkon, Karbonn, Lemon)
And many more small&big IT&Finance companies starting their operations from AP

Imagine what can be done with a special status/package if fully implemented.

#APTheSunriseState #AP #MadeinAndhra"
CBN is a credible leader 1000 times better than modi... Who had studied just 9 th class..  He is worst pm in India history who has not completed even school level education
Because of jagan CBN becomes active.Jagan is the real player.
"Chandrababu Naidu - your greedy for money is never ending. How much more money, Andhra Pradesh would get as packages for improving your state? We have so many Indian states to improve. You want to get special status for AP just like Jammu Kashmir. That's not possible. Actually, Chhattisgarh,  needs special status."
"There is one fellow here named Malli K , who does not have guts to reply back, simply commenting good for nothing fellow"
"Jai jai naidu...jii...

"Mr CBN should have done this long back.
